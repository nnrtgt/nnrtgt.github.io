But after joining Target, (Captive IT Company) I understood the scale at which Retail Businesses leverage Technology.","title":"Technology in Retail"},{"location":"blogs/lead/leaderstories/","text":"How to be a top performer As part of the annual review process, a lot of companies give their managers a performance rating, based on how well they did their job that year. It's sort of like getting a grade in school. For example, the top 20% of performers might get one rating, and the next best 50% might get a two rating, and a bottom 30% might get a three rating. I've often been asked by junior managers, what do I need to have on my work plan next year to get a one rating? And you've probably asked or been asked the same question a few times yourself. It's an impossible question to answer. Mostly because it depends on how well the other people do. It's a forced curve. If everybody has a great year, it'll be much harder to get a one rating than in a typical year. Well, after several years of managing people, I noticed that most of the people who get the one rating did so because they accomplished something they didn't plan on, right? A problem came up or an opportunity presented itself and they just jumped on it, right, turning it into a victory. So after years of trying and failing to explain that to people in a satisfactorily manner, I finally came across a story about a scientist that really captured the essence of the idea. And at almost 200 years old, the story may be at least partially apocryphal. But since I'm not teaching a science class, I still find it useful. Here's what I tell those inquiring minds today. Hans Christian Oersted was a Danish physicist at the University of Copenhagen in the early 1800s. Well, on the night of April 21st, 1820, Oersted gave a lecture to his students on electricity. He had a simple wire circuit connected to a battery and a voltage meter to show the current level. Well, as legend has it, sometime during the demonstration, Oersted noticed a magnetic compass on the table. He picked it up and moved it out of the way. Well, as he did, he noticed that the compass needle jumped a little as it moved passed the electric current. So he moved it back near the wire, just to see what would happen, and it jumped again. Well, after the demonstration he asked one of his assistants if he'd ever seen that happen. His assistant responded very matter-of-factly, sure, it happens all the time, so what? Well, that intrigued Oersted. So he continued to experiment with it over the next several months and eventually demonstrated a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Electric currents generate magnetic currents. Magnetic currents generate electric currents. So this phenomenon is now known as electromagnetism. It's the underlying mechanism that explains the light we see, the television and radio waves that entertain us, the cell phone signals that keep us in touch. Even the microwaves that cook our food and x-rays that help diagnose our ailments. In fact, much of modern physics, including Einstein's theory of relativity, as well as quantum mechanics, has it roots in electromagnetism. Now, the lesson for us, though, is that Hans Christian Oersted didn't become the discoverer of electromagnetism because he was looking for it, right? It wasn't on his work plan. He also wasn't the first person to notice the fact that magnetic compasses freak out a little when they get near an electric current. He discovered electromagnetism because he was the first one to recognize the significance of that jittery compass and he pursued it. So if you want to be a top performer, first, have a strong work plan and accomplish everything on it. But then, pay attention to what's going on around you. Watch for something interesting to happen in your business. Be curious. Ask yourself if there's something significant going on, and if so, jump on it. Crisis communication In June of 2000, Andrew Moorfield started an online bank to help make loans to small businesses. But as with a lot of companies at start-up, there were times when there wasn't enough cash to pay the bills. In fact, he told me, \"The first time I couldn't make payroll was the worst.\" Right? Having to choose who got paid and who didn't was emotionally draining. Now most leaders in big companies would've handled a situation like that by issuing a vague company-wide memo saying something like, unfortunately, the company's current financial condition requires that we make adjustments to employee salaries and benefits for an indeterminate period of time. Compensation will return to normal levels when key balance-sheet metrics are restored. Now, there might be times when that kind of management speak is necessary, but you at least have to admit that communication practices like that, especially during a time of crisis, create more questions than answers. Well, how big of an adjustment? Is my adjustment more or less than everyone else's? And what's wrong with our financial condition anyway? All right? The result would be widespread suspicion, and jealousy, and complete lack of trust. Well, fortunately, that's not what Andrew did. Here's what he did instead. He pulled all 25 employees into a conference room, and then he wrote a number at the top of the whiteboard, and he said, \"That was our bank account balance \"at the beginning of the month.\" And then just below that, he wrote two other numbers, and he said, \"Those are the revenues \"we expect to get this month, \"and the expenses that we have to pay \"to keep running the business.\" And then he drew a line, and he added them all up. Now, he wrote the answer underneath, and he said, \"That's what we'll have left \"at the end of the month to pay your salaries.\" And then he circled that number. And then just to the right of it, he wrote another number, and he circled it, and then he said, \"That's how much your monthly salaries add up to.\" And then he just paused. And he let the audience assess the stark dilemma in front of them, because the number on the right was three times the size of the number on the left. And then he did something else rather unusual. He asked all of the employees, all 25 of them, what they thought he should do about it. Now, he assumed, of course, the fairest thing to do would be to pay everyone 1/3 of their salary, but the team surprised him with a different suggestion. They thought a better method would be to pay 1/3 of the employees all of their salary, and the other 2/3 none. Well, Andrew was horrified. I mean, how could he possibly choose who to pay, and who not to pay. But they surprised him a second time when they offered to help there as well. They told him that they would decide among themselves. So Andrew left the room so they could talk in private. And when they called him back in, Andrew got his third surprise of the day. The people on the list to get paid weren't the ones he expected. And he thought the younger employees with the smaller salaries would be in the most desperate position. But among themselves, they decided that the older and more senior employees had the most immediate commitments. One of the younger employees explained it this way. She said, \"You know, most of us are single, \"and just rent a small flat downtown. \"We don't have a lot of bills. \"And I can even move back in with my parents if I have to. \"But the senior folks, \"they have families to feed, mortgages to pay.\" So the younger employees volunteered to go without. So Andrew learned two lessons from that experience for how to respond when faced with a difficult decision that will result in someone being disappointed. All right, first, be real, open, and honest about the situation, all right? Lay all the facts out in plain view. Don't shroud them in corporate secrecy, or describe the situation in vague terms. All right, second, ask the affected parties how they would respond if it was up to them. All right, and nine times out of 10, they'll come to the same conclusion that you did. And at that point, it's far easier for them to accept your decision because they recommended it. And occasionally, as in Andrew's case, they might even suggest a better solution that wouldn't have even occurred to you, all right? Now, Andrew's start-up eventually succeeded, and everyone got caught up in their pay. But he continues to heed the lessons he learned that first time that he couldn't make payroll, all right? How will you handle things the next time your organization finds itself in a crisis? Talking too much (or too little) Hey boss, did I talk enough in the meeting yesterday? That's the question Courtney Minor asked her boss one day, and it's one a lot of people have after a big meeting. Now, what they really want to know is if they showed up with the kind of leadership presence that they want to project. So let's talk about that and we'll use Courtney's example. So Courtney had recently been promoted and was working on an important project. One day, her team had the opportunity to present their work to leadership and ask for approval to fund their project to the next stage. And this happened to be Courtney's first time to present to the directors and general manager. But, it's a rite of passage we all go through. Well, the day after the big meeting, Courtney asked her director that question. Did I talk enough at the meeting yesterday? Now at first, her boss just looked confused. And then he said, that's not the right question to ask. Her eyes got really big and then he said, the question you should be asking is, did I accomplish my objectives? And then he asked her a few other questions. He said, did your team's progress get presented clearly? Well, she said yes. Did the key risks you identified get surfaced fairly? Yes, she said again. Now, were you able to answer all the questions in your area? Yes. And did the VP approve your project? Yes. Well, so he said, it sounds to me like you did great, congratulations. Well, that made Courtney feel better, but she wasn't done learning. He went on to explain why she was asking the wrong question. He said there's no shortage of bad advice about how to show up in a meeting and one of the worst pieces I've heard is, if you want to be seen as a leader, you need to say something in the first three minutes of a meeting. Now I'm sure there's some legitimacy to that advice, but it generally leads to the opposite outcome. Now I'm sure you've seen people who try it, and you know they sit impatiently on the edge of their seat, desperately waiting for an opportunity to get a word into the conversation. It usually results in them blurting out some inane comment that only serves to convince the rest of the group that somebody likes to hear themselves talk. You know, if your concern is whether you talked enough, you're at risk of falling into that same trap. There are enough eager young MBA's in the room to fill the quota of people racing to beat the three minute clock. You don't need to be one of them. And then he said, consider this alternative. When Ashwini Poorwal was director of this department, the president and all the directors were planning a trip to one of the field sales offices. To get ready for the trip, one of them wrote an email to the sales team just to introduce each member of the leadership team and share a few key insights about each one prior to the visit. Well, the author wrote a paragraph for each team member, starting with the president, Bob McDonald. Bob likes to talk the big picture, don't sugar coat the issues, just tell it like it is. He'll probably ask about pricing, etc. Well a few paragraphs into the email, it got to Ashwini. But, instead of a full paragraph, all it said about him was this. Ashwini Porwal-Research Director. Doesn't say much, but when he does, you'd better listen. Bob McDonald will be. Period. So, which personal equity do you want to have? Now you can follow the three minute rule and be seen as an arrogant person who likes the sound of her own voice, or you can follow Ashwini's example. And when you talk, people will shut up and listen. Now, at that point, Courtney felt better about her performance in the meeting. Plus, she had a much better mental picture of what good leadership presence looks like. Worrying about whether she talked enough was no longer part of it. And hopefully it won't be for you either. Learn jaw-dropping candor Two people who are used to being told they're right about everything are your boss and your customers. And that's why one way to make an unforgettable impact on those people is to tell them they're wrong. And it can be done with as little as a single word. Consider the following examples from Gary Kaufer. Gary was an executive vice president at an analytics company specializing in retail sales data. In 2010, he was just finishing up a meeting with one of his clients, and as they were walking out, the CEO asked him what Gary describes as an affirmation-seeking question. You know the type. It's the kind of question people ask in hopes you'll say yes and reaffirm whatever flattering notions they have about themselves already. Well, in this case, the question was this. \"I understand we're best-in-class among your clients \"using your data. Isn't that right, Gary?\" It's a pretty safe question for the customer to ask the hired help. The customer's always right, after all. Well, Gary's answer stopped the CEO in his tracks, literally. \"No,\" Gary told him. \"You're not.\" The CEO stopped walking, turned and looked at Gary with wide-open eyes. \"Oh\" was all he could manage at first, and then he followed that with \"What do you mean?\" Gary's response was equally surprising. Actually he said, \"I don't even think \"you're getting your money's worth out of us yet.\" The CEO couldn't believe what he was hearing. He said, \"Really? That sounds like something \"I should be complaining to you about, \"not the other way around.\" So Gary explained that in addition to the basic sales and loyalty data, his company offers dozens of advanced analytical services to help its clients make better decisions, and several of them were included in the fee they were already paying, but for some reason, they just hadn't been taking advantage of them. Well, 30 years of sales and general management experience has taught Gary that there are two ways that clients typically find out they're not getting enough value from one of their agencies. First, they figure it out for themselves and they complain about it. Or second, a competing agency approaches them and points it out. Now either way, it usually ends with the agency losing the account. Well, Gary prefers a third option. Tell them about it yourself, and then fix it. And in this case, that's exactly what he did. In a similar situation with another client, Gary was even more direct. He told the client, \"You should fire us.\" Can you imagine a more arresting statement from an agent? Yeah, me neither. But for Gary, it prompted the same kind of conversation that led to the client better leveraging the capabilities his company had to offer. And in both cases, business for the client and Gary's agency increased significantly. And in both cases, it was due in large part to Gary Kaufer's jaw-dropping candor and being willing to tell the customer or the boss that they're wrong. Now I suppose if you did that a half a dozen times every day, it wouldn't be as effective. It's the rarity of it that gives it the shock value and the effectiveness. Try it yourself next time you get asked one of those self-affirming questions. Great results vs. happy people Sara Mathew joined Dun & Bradstreet in August 2001 as chief financial officer. Less than a year later, she discovered the company had been accidentally overstating their revenues for years. Apparently, there are all kinds of arcane accounting rules about how you have to recognize complicated revenue sources, but D&B had apparently been using the wrong method for some time. So they had to completely restate their books for several prior years, and they had to get it done in six weeks before the next quarterly earnings release. Well, as you can imagine, that took an enormous amount of work for the finance and accounting department. Long days, sometimes working well into the night and through the weekends. But they eventually got it done, and on time. And the speed and accuracy of their work gave Wall Street analysts confidence that there wouldn't be any more skeletons that came out of their closet later. So there stock price didn't take the kind of hit that you might expect. Yeah, it was a bad situation, but Sara's team handled it really well, and Sara's leadership seemed like the obvious reason for that, until a few weeks later, that is. So once a year, everyone at D&B completes an employee satisfaction survey, and Sara had just gotten the results for her department. They were the worst in the company. Now, her organization was clearly sending her a message about how she had gotten the restatement done. The long hours and relentless focus had just ruined morale. In fact, the CEO called her into his office, and he was not happy. His opening line was, \"You're not leading well, Sara.\" Now, of course, Sara was disappointed in the survey, but in the light of what had happened with the restatement, it seemed inevitable to her. Now, she assumed that the ends justified the means that it took to get there. And her response reflected that. She said, \"You need to make a choice. \"Which do you want, great results or happy people?\" Well, the CEO's simple, but profound response was, \"Great leaders, Sara, do both.\" Now, those words hit Sara like a train. Now, it forced her to reflect on her own methods, and the impact that she can have on others in her urgency to deliver. Well, like most people, she was aware of her own strengths and weaknesses. She was a strong, strategic thinker, and a natural problem-solver. But she was also a terrible listener. She was direct to the point of being blunt. She was tough, demanding, and she played to win. If you were on the other side of the table from her, it could be intimidating. But the mistakes she made was assuming that that was just part of who she was and a necessary part of how she got things done. Well, her boss convinced her otherwise. So she decided to have several round table discussions with her employees to get direct feedback on her leadership style. And as she described it, it was a painful, humbling process. But she didn't just gather the feedback, she actually accepted it and acted on it. So two years later, her employee satisfaction scores were among the best in the company. Now, Sara shares this story today to teach the value of being a learning leader. Right, no matter how successful that you've been in the past, or what level you are in the organization, even bosses need to continually learn. Whether they're the CFO, the CEO, or the board chair, all roles that Sara's held. And if she hadn't learned the lesson, the hard lesson, that she did as CFO, she would've never been given the chance to have those second two roles, right? Don't let your success blind you to your own shortcomings, or the need to continually learn. Be a learning leader, and you can keep having the kind of success in your future that you've had in your past. How to receive tough feedback yourself So just because you know how to give constructive feedback doesn't mean you know how to receive it. Now one person who discovered a creative way to do that is Gayle Hollander. Now Gayle's been in the advertising business for 30 years. She's worked in some of the most prestigious agencies in New York and helped develop some of the most recognizable ads on TV today. And through most of her career, Gayle's role has been in account management. That means she's the one who meets with the clients and explains to her creative department what kind of ads to produce. So the people in the creative department have the good fortune of dealing with Gayle most of the time. Gayle, on the other hand, has to deal with as many as a dozen demanding, quirky, and sometimes challenging clients at a time. Well, one client she recalls was more problematic than most. No matter how good her team's ideas were they were just never good enough for him. He would yell and scream and throw his hands up in the air in their meetings. And no matter how hard she tried to explain herself he just never seemed to understand, let alone agree with her. In fact, he wanted Gayle off of the account. And since he was the paying customer he knew he'd probably get his way. All he had to do was call the director of client services at her agency. That's the person whose job it is to assign agency personnel to client teams. Now the ironic thing was, at this agency, the director of client services was Gayle Hollander. Well, when the call finally came in, she wasn't surprised. It was inevitable. But it was her job to listen patiently and empathetically as he detailed his list of reasons why he wanted her off the team. And this guy was no more tactful or gracious on the phone than he was in person. Now in any other setting Gayle would have respectfully disagreed with his assessment of her and defended her positions. But he didn't call to complain to Gayle Hollander, his account manager, he called to complain to Gayle Hollander, the director of client services. That's the role she had to play on that phone call. So that's who she was as she was listening. And when she honestly and objectively assessed the whole situation, she had to agree that she was just not a good fit for this client. She removed herself from the team and placed another person in the job. Now most of us will never have to be in that awkward position of listening to someone complain about us right to our face as if we weren't even there. But that's unfortunate because it also means we don't have the opportunity to listen to that feedback objectively as if it were directed at someone else. The lesson is this, when you receive feedback, especially negative feedback, it's easy to become defensive and emotional and blame others for your shortcomings. But when the feedback is about someone else it's easier to understand and to accept and to determine what kind of changes are likely to make it better the next time. So try putting yourself in Gayle's situation. When you are getting negative feedback think of yourself as the director of client services for the agency of you. Assess the feedback as if it were someone else, someone you work with and have an obligation to coach and mentor. You know, how would you advise your twin self to take the feedback and use it to change for the better? If you took every piece of feedback that way imagine how much you can improve, and you could do it without even having to fire yourself. Good vs. better vs. best performance If you're like most leaders, you're constantly asked what's the difference between good performance and great performance? After all, most people want to do their best if they just knew what that looked like. And if you're like more leaders, you've got a list of attributes in mind that you think are important in your business. And then you rattle them off to anyone who asks that question. The problem is, as you might have noticed, that most people when they hear your list, are already convinced that they meet most or all of them. Our human egos just make it difficult to think any other way. So if you tell them that communication, leadership, and analytical ability are the three most important skills to have, there's a pretty good chance the person you're talking to thinks that they've already got great communication, leadership, and analytical skills, right? And that's why rattling off a list is rarely helpful as a tool to develop your people. Now, here's a very different technique, used by one of the research leaders I interviewed. He made up a story. Seriously, he completely made up a story and it went something like this. Once, there was a market research manager who had three bright young researchers for her, but was only able to promote one of them. Well, to figure out which it would be she gave each of them this challenge. The one who best helps the next brand manager who comes through the door will win the promotion. Well, pretty soon a brand manager came in with this request. I have several new ideas for my brand, and I need you to place a concept test to pick the best one. So the research manager explained the competition and asked that the brand manager meet with each of her researchers separately. Well, at the end of the week, she called all three researchers in to present their plan. Now, the first researcher had designed the perfect concept test. Now that's a survey where different groups of consumers, each evaluate one of the concepts. And he included all the right questions in the survey to help pick the winner. \"Well done.\" Said the research manager. All right, when the second researcher stepped up to make her presentation, she proposed an entirely different test. The boss said, \"But the brand manager \"asked for a concept test. \"Why are you recommending something different?\" So she said, \"Well, when I looked at the new concepts, \"I realized that they were all very similar. \"In fact, I don't believe them to be testable different. \"They're all basically the same, \"with only a few minor differences in the wording. \"I know he asked for a concept test, \"but I didn't think that would answer the question \"that he came in with, which was, \"which one is the best concept? \"So asking different people to assess each concept, \"will probably give scores that are all about the same. \"My test will show the concepts to one group of people \"and ask them to pick the one \"with the most convincing wording. \"It should be easier to find a winner \"and much cheaper to execute.\" \"Excellent.\" Said the research manager. Then she asked the third researcher to present his plan. \"Actually, I don't have one.\" \"What, you had an entire week? \"I thought you wanted this promotion as much as everybody else.\" \"Oh, I do, I do. \"I just, I don't believe \"this brand needs any more research.\" \"Okay, you've got my attention, explain.\" \"Well, I understand the brand managers question \"was which of his new concepts was best? \"But after talking to him \"and looking at the research we already have, \"I realized that wasn't the right question to ask \"in the first place. \"The current concept scored great \"when we tested it a few months ago. \"The problem with this brand isn't the concept. \"The problem is price. \"So, the right question to ask would have been, \"what price do we need to have to be competitive? \"But we already know the answer to that question, \"because we conducted a pricing study 18 months ago. \"We know exactly how much we need to reduce our price, \"we've just never done it \"because we couldn't do that \"and afford the increase to our advertising budget \"that was already approved. \"So I checked our media schedules and found out \"that about 10% of our ad budget is completely wasted. \"Now if we cut that wasted ad spending, \"we'd have just enough to reduce the price \"back to competitive levels \"and that is what I recommend that we do.\" Now it should be no surprise that the researcher number three got the promotion, but the lesson for us is teaching the value of asking the right question. Even an average researcher can design, execute, and analyze the test asked for. A better researcher would first make sure it's the right test to answer the business question asked. But the best researcher, will make sure the right business question is being asked in the first place. Unfortunately, you can't just tell someone to make sure they're asking the right questions. It doesn't work that way. A story like this, real or imaginary, makes the point far better because they can see the difference. So instead of continuing to rattle off a list of skills, spend some time coming up with a fictional story that shows your employees the difference between how a good employee would handle a typical situation in your business, and how a great employee would handle exactly the same situation. You'll be much more successful teaching them what great performance looks like, and they'll be much more likely to admit that they're not already perfect.","title":"Leaderstories"},{"location":"blogs/lead/leadtech/","text":"More to come...

I think you have an interesting perspective of even when you have a new hire that starts with the company. - I do, so whenever we have somebody start on my team, one of the first conversations I have with them is this open, honest conversation about the fact that at some point they're going to leave. And so my job as their new manager or as their new organizational leader is to understand what they want to accomplish. It seems like a weird thing. - On the first day that someone's joining the company you're saying. - Totally. - What is their next play, what do you want to do next? As they start. - And for a lot of people, it's a little bit of a shocker that that's the first conversation that we have. But because somehow it's become taboo to even, for a manager to have a conversation with our employee. Like as a manager, I've got to hold onto my employees and if I ever talk to them about the fact that they might leave LinkedIn, well then it'll spark this idea in their heads that maybe they should, when the reality is, people all the time are thinking about their careers and applying for jobs and everything else. Let's have an open conversation about this. And inevitably, those people stay longer because you have open conversations about, they feel like they've stopped learning. They work harder. - I think they get the job done so much better. - [Erran] Totally. - I mean they're passionate, they want to do better, they're innovative as well, which is exciting. I mean it comes down to three things. I mean, really expand your current role, do something different within the company or leave. And if we can help them in any one of those paths, I think it makes like a huge difference and they're, they're going in the right direction. So it actually feels really good. It's not this horrible separation. - Our job as leaders is not to tell people what to do, it's to create, kind of a framework within which people can operate and feel like they've got autonomy and can be innovative, figure things out on their own. - Assess the goals and growth potential right from the start. Utilize talent on your team by aligning their goals with the company goals. (upbeat drum music) Awareness and feedback: Jeff Weiner (upbeat hip hop music) - Let's talk about what awareness means in leadership. We talked about this framework that makes a great leader. I would like to talk about some things that you've seen that weren't so great. - Way more-- - You see it everyday? - Way more than I can count. This is one thing that the more senior you become, the more people will weight your words. And so the more aware you need to be. So by way of example, you're sitting in a meeting and you are a member of the team and someone asks you what you think and you respond \"Oh I prefer this color over that color\" in terms of a design. And your colleague may say \"Okay, that's nice to know.\" - Right. - Or \"I disagree\". \"Maybe we'll do something with that information.\" And lo and behold, a couple of weeks later, it turns out the project is delayed because the team interpreted that piece of feedback as a mandate. - (laughs) Wow. - And so, now they have to undo all of the color codes and the palettes and that is what happens when executives, when leaders, when managers are not fully aware and conscious of the impact they're having on other people. So, a simple little framework that I've used with some success is, I love rules of three, so in this particular case, it's one person's opinion. I'm one person, you're another person-- - And your (mumbles) case is entirely different from somebody else-- - I've got an opinion, you've got an opinion. - Right. - Take it for what it's worth. - Right. - Next is a strong suggestion. - (laughs) Great. - A strong suggestion is more than one person's opinion. It comes from a place of experience. You say, \"Hey, I hear ya, I see the direction you're going, \"but, if I were you guys, I would strongly consider \"potentially doing it differently, \"but I want to be clear, the decision is yours.\" - Got it. - And then the third tier is the mandate. \"I think that you're going down a path that's going to \"lead to a bad outcome, \"and that could hurt you and/or the team, \"or the company, \"and so, I would prefer if you'd do it this way.\" - Wow. - If I could count mandates on one hand, I'd be surprised. It's, I wouldn't be able to use all the fingers. It's very, very rare, but in the absence of categorizing the kind of feedback you're providing, one person's opinion may be perceived as a mandate. - Got it. - And that's why it's important to distinguish between the three. - Yep. (upbeat hip hop music) New leader or new team: Ya Xu (upbeat music) - Ya Xu is an amazing woman. She has a PhD in statistics, she was formerly an applied researcher at Microsoft, and for the last six years, she has been right here at LinkedIn as one of our lead data scientists. How do you step into the leadership position of a team and build the trust of your team? (upbeat music) Another thing that I think is super, super core is trust. You could say, hey, this is my style, but if nobody trusts each other at the end of the day, I mean, that is the core part of it for you to accelerate your strategy, how fast you move, discussions, decisions, everything. Trust is so important. I would love to understand what your perspective is on trust. - Absolutely, I want to say trust is number one. Trust is the moment where you are able to push each other more, and that is a foundation to everything, that you can do it together, right? And I remember that Reid was the one who said trust is consistency over time. - Definitely. - And it definitely takes time to build trust. - A lot of time sometimes. - A lot of time, right. - And we want to shorten it. Didn't you have an idea of an algorithm that we could build? A machine algorithm that we could just build trust and it just happens? - That's right, that is right. I mean, totally, in terms of how we can build trust faster, there are, again going back to what we said earlier, which is like, a lot of this, you know, making sure that the folks understand each other's style. Not just me, they understand my style, I understand their style. At the same time just like spending the time and arguing with each other. I personally feel that every single time, and then it's not just me with my leads, but even me with my manager as well. When we disagree with each other on something and we spend time on it, and when we come out of it feeling so much more trusting. - Isn't that amazing? I think even when you go into that moment of disagreement or challenge... - Yeah. - You almost have a question of trust. Like, you know, do we have a good relationship? And it's actually working on it. - I know. - And then coming up with a different outcome you'll have actually the most trust. - Totally. - Going into a new team is really about listening. (upbeat music) Paying it forward: Erica Lockheimer Early on in my career, I remember someone had reached out to me and truly invested in me and wanting to help me progress in my career. I'll never forget it, his name's Frank, I'll never forget Frank, he's absolutely amazing and I think about those moments because I didn't ask for his help, he just saw that I needed help, which makes a huge difference. And I think if we can always have some awareness and recognize the people in the room that need that help and just go after it, it'd make a world of difference. And when he did it, I mean mentoring, sponsorship, that was not even in our dialogue, it wasn't something that we talked about, but I knew looking back in that moment, that's exactly what it was. When I was asked to be a mentor, you know you think about do I have the time, you know can I make this part of my life, and it was one of those moments that I just kept on saying, yes I need to, and I started diving in, stepping in, and it's been one of the most rewarding experiences for me and just feeling that you can help people, it feels great. I started volunteering my time quite a bit, I'm actually volunteering my time this weekend at a conference on a panel, and those are some of the most valuable conversations that I have had. I, I'm am also in a unique position where I get to lead Women in Tech at LinkedIn. It's it's so impactful on on so many ways, where I can now influence change, I can create change, I can innovate change, and I could bring the community together to help people working at LinkedIn and outside of LinkedIn. I'm truly in the best part of my career right now and I can bring those two worlds together. One of the best pieces of advice that I've heard is from a great leader at LinkedIn, and that was to use the voice that you have earned. Sometimes when you're growing and you're realizing that you're growing in your career and you almost don't realize this voice that you, that you now have that is in your control, you have to use it, you've earned it, and you're in a position to actually make a larger impact than you think. So again, use the voice that you've earned. I think the best advice that I can give is for you to think about how you can step in and help someone and truly pay it forward. We're all busy, hundred percent get it, but there is moments in your, in your life and some daily thing that you can do that you can just take that and say, \"hey this is where I'm going to reach and help someone.\" It doesn't actually take a long time to do, and it doesn't have to be this massive investment, it could just be a small moment of just reaching out and lending a hand in your day-to-day life. So I think, think about it, think about your space, and see how you can give back and pay it forward. Public speaking for leaders: Tim Fortescue (upbeat music) - So I got invited to this workshop for public speaking. It was for two days; two days of my time. I was thinking there's no way that I can do that, but I decided to take the leap and attend the workshop, and that is where I met Tim Fortescue, who's one of the most sought after communication coaches in Silicon Valley. As a communication coach, Tim believes in working with your strength instead of breaking you down. He has helped me be authentic in my communication style and vulnerable at the same time, which is really, really hard to do. I remember, it was a two day workshop, and I was thinking, I don't know how I can take two days off work, I'm just busy, busy, busy, but it makes you realize that you need to take the time to invest in yourself, and so, chose to do it, so. - Yeah, well I'm glad you were there, because after that event, that's when we started working one on one. - Yep. I think that that's what the art is right? Even that workshop, you're in a massive group of people. Us then having the one-on-one relationship to kind of work on the hard stuff and like craft a story, I think there was a trust that we had to start even building together, and sharing, I had to share some of my stories, you had to share your, and we had, all of a sudden I'm just going to talk to this guy Tim, and tell 'em all about my life, and we're going to craft a story, it's going to be great. It takes some warming up to do, and I think that I was comfortable talking to you about things, because you were vulnerable with me. (upbeat music) You need to connect with your audience, and the best way to do that, is with emotion. What is important for people who are watching this and they're thinking, well how can I be better as a communicator or better as a speaker, establishing an emotional connection with your audience is right at the tip of that list, and it's something you've done well since before we ever worked together. - And you say that that's like one of the most important things to do, but, being authentic, and being connecting to the audience, and putting yourself out there in front of a whole bunch of people, is a lot more challenging than you think. I mean it plays with your psyche, I think you focus on all the tactical stuff, the ums and all those things, and this is the message, this is what I'm supposed to do, but I think you've also had this thing, there's a quote that people will not, they will forget what you said but they will never forget how you made them feel, and I think that that has resonated with me in so many ways, because now it just becomes more fun. We all have different things we're working on. My biggest challenge is talking too fast. - Yeah, we all have an audience, all the time, whether you're on stage, like you are now, or whether you never get on a big stage, but you talk at your weekly meetings. Actually, the majority of our clients, the majority of the people we work with, never get on stage, it's like you do at this point, and communication is such an important skill that everybody at every level, age and experience level, can work on this and it pays off quite a bit. - Yep, I think the key thing is we're always in meetings everyday, even that one-on-one conversation can be that moment, and you're practicing this skill everyday to get your message across, be authentic, be real, pause is also very important, even in those conversations, because it's also a two-way conversation. Like pause, also gives you a chance to hear what else, someone else has to say, and have them truly absorb what you just said. - Authenticity can overcome a lot of technical issues for communicators, and sometimes people say, well duh, of course, I should be myself more, but it's hard to do-- - Oh, it's so hard. - Because there is a vulnerability to just being yourself, owning your style in front of any group, but that's really the key to being, to connecting emotionally and being a better speaker. - Yeah, I think, I like what you've just said, is owning your own style. I think what's interesting sometimes, I've found, is I will see someone speaking in a room, we're like, wow, they're really great, right, and you almost want to be, oh I want to be like them. It's great to idolize and there's some role modeling there, but I think you have to figure out what your own style is, because then, it isn't authentic, right, and I think you have to kind of figure out the balance between those two, of learning things from others, but then bringing in your own unique style into it. What are the unique challenges when speaking in the tech sector? - We talk too much. - Ha, really? - Yeah, too much detail, too much talking, we need to start with the end in mind, and start with what's in it for the audience that's listening to that message, whether it's in a meeting or on a big stage scenario. Think about what are the one or two key points I need to, we need to convey, and make it impactful for that audience, less is more. (upbeat music) Career change best foot forward: Jennifer Shappley (upbeat music) - Finding the right talent is the key to building successful teams for all companies of any size, today I'm talking to Jennifer Shappley. Who is the senior director for recruiting the best engineering talent for all of LinkedIn. I am so thrilled to have her expertise working for us, because Jennifer loves finding the best talent and building highly engaged teams. So Jennifer, you've been at this for quite awhile. You are head of recruiting for all of LinkedIn's engineering which is amazing! I would love to know how did you get to where you're at, how did you start off and what are you doing today? - Yeah so I've been in recruiting about 15 years but the first two years before I got into recruiting I was in just kind of a general HR role. I did everything from 401k administration to benefits and onboarding new employees, and through that figured out recruiting was actually what I was really interested in. The head of recruiting for the company I worked for at the time happened to be in town and offered to let me spend a week with his recruiters. Got the bug and really never looked back. But that time doing other pieces of HR did give me an appreciation for what all of our partners do in HR and how within recruiting it's really important we all work together. (upbeat music) - What makes a great interview? - I think there are a few things that make up a great interview, I mean first you want to leave the interviewer with a feeling of you could do the job. So first and foremost you want to get across that you can do the job really well. And then you've got to remember there are a lot of things going on in the day of an interviewer. - Very true. - And the time that you are interviewing should be of the utmost importance but there are a lot of other things that are going through somebody's mind. They go to an interview they go to another meeting et cetera and so what I think is so important for candidates to know is anything you can do to be memorable is important and will turn that into a great interview. So how you answer questions, how you share information doing it in a way that is unique to you, so that that interviewer remembers you really is the hallmark of a great interview. - Give me some examples of maybe an exchange of why would it be memorable for somebody? What does that look like? - Yeah so when you talk about stories and the ability to tell a good story. One of the reasons stories are so important is because we know they're more memorable. You're going to remember if I tell you a story way more than you're going to remember if I spit a bunch of facts at you, and also let's not forget when interviewing you're most likely being compared to other candidates. - All the time. - All the time, right? - Part of the progress (laughing). - Usually how it works, and so you're not the only person under consideration, and so if I ask you a question about you know tell me about your leadership style and you say oh well I really I make sure that I talk with my teams regularly and I cascade information and I support them in all their career goals. Well you've answered the question-- - You've answered the question but ehh it sounds pretty basic. - Yeah that sounds like sure what we would expect you to do. But if you say let me tell you about an example of one of my employees. - I like that. - And I had this employee and they were really struggling in the new role and I could tell and so here's what I did to actually help them with that, and I think that kind of exemplifies how I work as a leader. That is inherently going to be unique to you, 'cause it's your story so they're going to remember it and it helps differentiate you and so just the difference between answering with facts versus answering with stories can make a huge difference in the interview. (upbeat music) - A one on one interview is an interesting dynamic. - I think it's so important to think about an interviewer as a two, interview as a two way conversation. So it shouldn't be the interviewer just talking the whole time which is a common mistake that interviewers make, and it also shouldn't be the interviewee just talking over and over, and so as an interviewee it's important to think about making sure you're allowing for that rhythm of the back and forth, creating more of a conversational style. Most people don't interview all the time and it's a really nerve wracking thing-- - a lot of people are not great at interviewing. - No. - It's a skill set. - Absolutely. - It's not like you're in your job most of the time and all the sudden now you need to interview after five years-- - And now I've got to prove I can do it, yeah. And that's scary, and then maybe you're completely capable of doing the job but it's scary for you, how do you show that in an interview? And so my tips to candidates are really think about it, the back and forth conversation. If you're interviewing for a role, most likely you are an expert in this space. So think about it as an opportunity to have a conversation with someone and a back and forth and explaining why you are great for this role. Not so much I am sitting here and being judged and we know there are techniques that make a great interviewer. A great interviewer will ask questions that are open ended, that are situational, they'll probe with more detailed questions. So some candidates give more generic answers, and a great interviewer will know how to probe to get the details, there are on guarantees that when you go to interview for a job that you are going to get a great interviewer. - No that's true, that's true some people are also not great interviewers. - Exactly so you know there's only so much as an interviewee that you can control. So a great interviewer knows to probe and ask for those details, a great interviewee knows to lead with them, so don't let the assessment of your ability to do the job fully rely on the quality of the interviewer. Make sure you're thinking about being specific, using stories, being concise as a way to kind of balance that out. (upbeat music) Growth mindset: Chris Pruett Having a growth mindset about your career and getting honest feedback is critical for anyone to grow. My colleague Chris Pruett, he's the VP of Engineering for LinkedIn.com for our consumer business, and we met each other seven years ago. We built trust and a relationship together where we can give that honest feedback to one another. And I'm super excited to sit down with him and share some of our advice together. I think we should probably reflect a little bit about how we got to where we're at, but then also maybe how we've changed through our careers, even before LinkedIn. - You know, early in my career, I was certainly, I think I've always been someone that is always looking to do, you know, stay excited about what I'm doing. I operate best when I'm sort of outside of my comfort zone a little bit. You know, it's like I know what I like, but I want to just like kind of keep pushing myself. And until I got to LinkedIn, and probably for my first year or two at LinkedIn, it was all kind of not intentional, sort of accidental, right, I was very curious. Even to this date, if you ask me what do I look for in engineers, one of the top two things I'll say is curiosity. Like I want people that are intellectually curious and that they're going to learn, and I think that's a really important part of having a growth mindset is actually being curious about things and being willing to sort of go from the point of view that you don't know everything, right, there's-- - No, you don't have all the answers. - Exactly. - We're going into new territory all the time of building new things. - [Chris] Exactly. - What drives intentional growth? Now you're in this intentional path. Is that where you continue to be, or have you been toggling back or forth, or? - Absolutely, I think what I've learned to do over time, and something that you have helped me tremendously with is actually talk about it, have these sort of very transparent, vulnerable conversations. - I think that's a great example, and I remember us having these pretty intense conversations about a year and a half ago of, be more intentional about where we wanted to go. And I remember thinking, you know, we were having similar conversations even within the company of similar roles that we both were interested in. - Well I mean, I took your old job. - Yes, you did take my old job. (both laughing) But it was, I think the relationship that we had, that we were able to talk about that. And whatever the outcome was, I mean, obviously we work at a great company where transformation, next play, all those things, you know, we embrace, but we were able to have a very vulnerable conversation that may end up in the same place, maybe switching each other's jobs, all around, and also not only talking to each other about it, but I think going back to the point that you mentioned earlier, that you need to describe exactly what you want so other people can help you get there. - You have to also trust that you can be wrong in that. Be really acutely self-aware of like where you are today, and be open to changing and knowing that you can. - It helps to have an ally on a similar career path. - You know, one thing we say here is relationships matter. And I think that to be an ally has a number of really important meanings. To me, I think it's someone who you just deeply trust, that you can be really vulnerable with. Ideally, it's a two-way connection, right, I think that, you know, you can trust that like you're really not beating around the bush, right, you're being very direct about what is it. Like you said-- - It's like don't waste my time, let's just get straight to the point. - Yeah, even if understanding feedback for what it is, right, like helping someone say, \"Hey, hey, stop being defensive, \"let's figure out why someone bought this,\" right, whether or not you think it's true. - And I think we've called each other out on some pretty transparent stuff before, but it's like helpful, it's like that's what you need to hear. - For example. - [Erica] For example (laughs), let's get down to the details. - Okay. - No, but I, you know, this came up in a recent one-on-one conversation, someone asked me out for coffee and they were newer to the company and they said, \"Hey, I need a mentor, could we spend more time together?\" And it's that allyship that I think it's like these, a set of people that you trust, but it takes time, but like how do you get there, I always get like how do I start establishing it. - So I think-- - It sounds great, but how are you going to do it? - I connect most when like, I try to bring my whole self here, right, and I want people that want that, right, that are actually interested in the fact that I have three kids and two dogs and live in the mountains, right, like build it over time, right, just over time just figure out who you - Like any relationship, it takes time. - Have rapport with, you figure out, you know, people that, for me, I think people that really challenge me. - Right, you need to have where I want to surround myself with people that are smarter than me in different areas, and I think that that is core because that's how you're going to grow, that's how you're going to be more intentional about where you want to go and with the kind of person or leader that you want to be. But I think there's an ending point here, that it was something I learned from you, as well, in our conversation, is that in order for that to happen is that you have to change. You have to really want to change. - You have to want to change. Exactly, like the clearer you can be about what you're trying to get to, you have to want that, be intentional about growing into that. - Yep, I love it, it's awesome Chris. Fantastic. - Nice. - Yeah. (hands slap) (upbeat music) Feedback and career conversations: Fiona Trayler Early in my career, I was often scared to give feedback 'cause feedback can be scary. It's not always positive. I met up with Fiona Trayler, She is the senior director for content production at LinkedIn Learning. She has experience working with huge teams in high-pressure environments, in both the feature film world and in high-quality educational video. And so that's why I'm super excited to sit down with Fiona and see how she handled feedback early in her career and how she's doing it now. Fiona, I heard you have a non-traditional background. I want to hear more about it. - I definitely don't have the background that most people would expect me to have, considering the resume. I actually started off more on an apprenticeship, as opposed to actually going through the academic college/university path. I started off as a dialogue editor, then went to be sound effects editor, then a video editor, and then a film editor, which encompasses being responsible for all of those crafts coming together in the final product. So it was layers of knowing the business and with knowing the business, you start actually adding layers to the craft. - Got it, so in all these roles, I'm sure you were absolutely perfect at all of them. (Fiona laughs) - Never. - So you can maybe share an example or maybe a story when you didn't do that well, and talk a little bit about feedback and feedback that you were given. Well, I think the first three years of me managing, I was a complete hot mess. I was a disaster. There wasn't actually a apprenticeship to be a manager. There was an apprenticeship to do the craft, but not how to actually manage people to perform in that craft. I had really good conversations with the director and the producer of the film I was working on at the time, and they gave me incredible feedback which was be the manager you wish you had. That was it, and it clicked. And it may be a simple thing to hear, but it kind of pushed it all back on me and said what kind of manager do I actually want to have. - Through her background and experience, she has gained enormous insights on the topic of giving and getting feedback as a leader. So I'm curious to see what she has to say about the topic and where she sees the challenges. - Have you ever gone through 360? - Yes, a while ago. I need to probably do one again (laughs). Why, did you have one recently? - I had one for the first time a couple of years ago. It was actually a couple years after I joined Lynda. And I had found that my career, it was in a good place, but I wasn't sure where the areas actually were. I will say that 360 feedback that I got was probably one of those catalyst moments in my career. It was such powerful feedback. It wasn't people telling me what to do. It was people telling me how they felt. - Wow, and that's hard. - That's hard. And I would encourage anybody, if you're looking for personal development in certain areas, go to individuals. Find somebody within your team. It's not always your manager. Sometimes it's a peer, a colleague. - Actually think a lot of the time, it's not your manager. I mean, your manager's there to help craft it, but it's really your peers around you about how they feel, how you're interacting with them. Are you having these trade-off discussions where you understand their world and they understand your world? I think actually the peers, to me, is the number-one thing. - Yeah. - Building a company culture that is open, honest, and constructive is key. And I really want to focus on the constructive part because that is where the magic happens. - The big thing about getting feedback is you are going to hear about areas to improve. - Yeah, that's a fact. That's the point. - Ouch, ouch! We're all trying our best, but when we're working really, really hard, we have one lens that we're looking at life through. And we're working so hard doing it, we may not be seeing some of the things which are actually disconnecting us from where we need to be. And getting somebody that you trust is coming with feedback that is valuable, it's constructive, it's not judgmental, it is a building process, that's critical. As a person who's looking for feedback, you have to be honest with what your goals actually are with feedback. The more that you're actually able to put a direction on it, and say, \"I'm actually looking to do these kind of things. \"This is the direction I'm trying to get.\" - Be really specific. - And I want to know if I'm connecting in the way that I want to connect. Otherwise, you might start getting feedback about things which are not necessarily valuable and you can build on them, but it's not going to get you where you want to go. And they should also be action things too, as well. It shouldn't just be feedback which just sits there passively. It's this is what I saw. These are areas to actually build on. When you can apply it again? The whole thing is, any kind of career, you're the driver or you're giving the wheel to somebody else. Where is it? So if you're the driver, it means you've got both hands on those wheels. You're the one with the gas pedal. You're the one with the brake. And you're looking from a copilot about where should we be going and getting advice on the way. If you give up, that part and you're passive, you're sitting in a parking lot. - I love this analogy; that is awesome. I'm going to write this stuff down (laughs). We have it recorded hopefully, somewhere, right? Feedback is a gift. It's really about creating the next version of yourself, really your version 2.0. So be proactive, go out there and ask for it. Leadership, execution, and craftsmanship: Erran Berger (upbeat pop music) - Leadership, execution, and craftsmanship is how we measure technical talent at LinkedIn. To explore these concepts, I'm going to sit down with Erran Berger, one of the top executives for engineering at LinkedIn. What does leadership mean to you when you look at talent and you're trying to make sure that someone is excelling? - Yeah, for me there are couple really important things in leadership and maybe we can talk about some stories or examples to really bring this to life. So, the first one, development of talent. - Yes - And coaching and mentorship and hiring. Like, this whole notion about I've got to form this team and help them grow is by far in my opinion, the most important aspect of leadership. So, who am I hiring and what is their talent? Am I building a diverse team? And an inclusive team, am I grooming and developing the employees who are already on my team to get to the next level? Am I not just doing it within my team but-- - Outside your team! - Totally-- - It's also important-- - Especially as a senior leader-- - Yeah, you have to! - Who am I coaching and mentoring developing outside of my immediate team? - But I think on the leadership sometimes that word can just be like oh I'm a manager, I'm a leader, I'm you know. It's not about telling people what to do and I think you just touched on it a bit. It's about having that influence. We're only the best, we're only as good as the stories we tell we have to paint that vision. It's not about being a leader, you need to do this and dictate all these things. It's about painting that vision and that strategy so I think that that is really key. What is key to execution? - So I know another thing that's really near and dear to both of our hearts. Just being people that are action oriented as execution right-- - Yes, high on execution. - I would love to hear from you a little bit about what you think makes somebody amazing in execution. - Yeah, execution is probably one of those things that I tend to put a lot of weight on. Because I think at the end of the day we can be great leaders, we can build amazing technology. But if we're not moving the needle, if we're not executing in some way then what matters? And so I think execution is core of making sure that you're working on the right things also. So sometimes, I mean we're always you know, balancing we have to do this and that and it's just sometimes a struggle of a balance of building you know, the most solid foundation the best new feature. And understanding to have a holistic view of what you're looking at, being able to make those conscious trade offs. And also presenting that to the table. So I'm a big fan of not making those decisions of what we're going to execute on in my own world. I need to basically work with my partners. Work with my product peers, my engineering partners, everybody across the organization. Say hey this is my point of view. At the end of the day are we impacting the bottom line of the vision or the mission you know with LinkedIn? You tie it to that and if you're working on that and that doesn't tie into that, then I would question, are we executing on the right things? - A hundred percent! - The C in LEC is for craftsmanship. But how do you define it? Craftsmanship is key, what does that mean to you? - Making the right decisions between what the business needs now and what our members need now. And what is going to make the software rights sustainable for the longterm. And what I mean by that is, in any moment in time there is something that like we just talked about that's just super urgent. Like we could make another 1,000,000 dollars if we do this. And we might be able to do that with a couple weeks worth of work but then... - What's the cost of doing that-- - Six months down the line we're going to have to do it all over again right? If it's going to take us a year to do something that would generate the 1,000,000 dollars that we could just do in two weeks, well like that doesn't seem like the right trade off either. And so the art of craftsmanship is striking this balance between realizing the things we want to do from an execution perceptive and making sure things are sustainable and long lasting. Making the product that our members use feel elegant and intuitive and something that just works for them. - Yeah, they shouldn't have to worry about if something's down or something doesn't work. I mean we have this notion of being proud to ship. - And not just it works but it like feels good to use it. - Like our members should not see all our craftsmanship under, they should see high bar of craftsmanship and it just, it works. It works. We need to care about how the technology is built and how it makes people feel. Work and life balance: Tanya Staples So establishing a work-life balance is not easy, right? It's often talked about, but what does it really look like? I caught up with Tanya Staples, Vice President of Product at LinkedIn Learning. Over the last year I've gotten to know Tanya, and I think she's got some great ideas. Now I'm going to find out what her secrets are. Okay, I'm going to find out some secrets about you. No, I'm honestly really curious about when you first, you know, had your child. Like, how did you figure out, what did you do? Did you take time off, I just, I have a million questions, I'd love to know. - I think that really what I learned, kind of in the first year or two of having, you know, being a mom, right, is you sort of have to balance yourself as a mom. Like we all feel this tremendous sense of guilt about working. - Exactly, yep. - Right, we all feel a lot of guilt. It's really important to have an identity as an individual, and that's your work life and your personal life. You know, some moms choose to stay home and I think that's a great decision and it works for them. I think the caveat I would make is that you still have to have your own identity. - [Erica] Yep, definitely. - And your professional identity is really, really important, because five years from now your kids don't need you! - [Erica] They don't, no. No. - It's like, yeah, bye mom. - Yeah. - And I think what I've learned is that it's about having balance, you know, of like, I have to be an interesting human being, not just a crazy work person. - Yep. One thing that I remembered earlier being an engineer and just coding all the time, is we were just working around the clock. Like, there was times I'd be up until one or two in the morning cause you kind of need those blocks of time, and I remember still doing that in my early days of LinkedIn, but, and then you have a baby, right? And it's like, how do you, like, shift your hours and make sure that, okay, I still have those blocks of time and then setting those boundaries like no, I got to leave at this time to pick up my child from daycare, right? But then you have this, again that guilt sets in in a different way, well, you know, lot of engineers are in the office and they're staying out their time but I got to go, my life is in a different stage right now, but I began to embrace that because I figured hey, that's the time that I need. It's kind of like software, you AB test everything that you do in your life, it's like at that time, that worked, at this time, it no longer works, and so I've been able to say no, I'm leaving, and that's the boundary that I need to set for myself. And I think that we all have to get used to understanding what works for you may not work for me. - Yeah, well I mean life changes, I mean, what our kids need from us, what our marriage needs from us, what our other family commitments need from us, change on a very regular basis, and so it's about understanding the ingredients, I think, that work. - Yeah, I like that, I like that. - And then, kind of adjusting, I need a little more of this, I need a little less of that, I need a little more of this, I need a little less of that. - Setting boundaries is so important. You shouldn't feel guilty or apologetic about it. You should feel confident in your decisions and take the time. Every day you're setting these boundaries, like, I will ... - Definitely. - Newsflash, I do not like to take any meetings before 10 o'clock, if I don't have to. Because I honestly, I run every single morning, and that's my thinking time, and I will think about my day, I'll think about my problem-solving that I need to do within my team, or whatever, 'cause you need that think time and you need that space, that is my work hour, like, running in the morning with the dog, it's like this meditation, tap, tap, tap, and I think about the things I need to solve. - I'm similar for a different boundary, which is you know, my son started High School this year. For me, I take him to school every morning. - Wow, that's awesome. - And I'm not going to give that up, because that's our time where we have, it's just the two of us, we're not on our phones, and you know sometimes we don't say anything at all and other times we have like these really deep, insightful conversations. - That's great. - Yeah, I'll tend to stay until, you know, 6:00 or 6:30, but then I'm done. - [Erica] Yeah, you know how to shut off. - 'cause I think one thing both of our families do, is we eat dinner together. - Yeah. Yeah, right. - Right, we eat dinner together as families. - I totally agree, that's like the one time you're talking about everything throughout your whole day, what's ahead, what did you just accomplish. - Exactly. And it makes a big difference. - [Erica] It is, and just focus. - Talking, talking, talking. Lots of talking. - I think it is so important to take time off. You need time off to think, to recharge, and then get back in the groove of what you're working on. And I've seen it time and time again, where people will take a whole week off, two weeks off on vacation, they come back to work and they are so excited to get the ball rolling. In fact, I'm going on vacation, next week. - I hear a lot of people be like, oh, I want to travel here, and I want to do this, and I want to take more vacation, but there's just never a good time, it's like, here's a newsflash. - There's never a good time. - There's never a good time. Nothing really that catastrophic is going to happen. - No, everything'll be okay. - Put this pressure on ourselves like, I got to be there, I got to do this, I got to do this, I got to do this, but like, everybody stay calm. No-one's going to die. - No-one's going to die. - Right? It's going to be fine, we can take-- - I love it. You just took that crazy, long trip, which is awesome. - Yep, Vietnam and Laos, yeah, I took a three-week leave. - Three weeks? - Yeah but I planned it for a year. I mean it was fine because I planned for it. (upbeat music) Beyond coding careers in tech: Igor Perisic Igor Perisic is the Chief Data Officer at LinkedIn. The data products created by his team power the personalized experiences for hundreds of millions of LinkedIn members around the world. Not only is he one of the top executives, he's an amazing mentor, who's an awesome listener and helps elevate people's voices so everyone is heard. That is his character. And now, you're Chief Data Officer. I mean that's like a big responsibility. (laughter) - You tell me. - How are you doing at this job? Are you nervous? You always had that sense of responsibility in your work, but now your organization is responsible for that. How does that feel? - There's some things that are much easier than before. Before, as you're growing up, you get the feeling at some point or time you have to do everything. And any time there's a fire, you have to be the one that sort of digs in. And what ends up happening when you do those kinds of things is that actually you're not giving the space for others to develop. Remember Henke always used to tell us- - I love David Henke. - You're as good as your lieutenants. For a long time, when he said this, eh, I don't know what you're talking about. Of course, then later on you really internalize what he truly means. You give them the space to pick that up. And if you dig in all the time, you're not giving them the space to pick it up. And if you give them the space to pick up something that's already polished and finished, they haven't learned and grown through it. So it cannot be polished and finished. They need to step in. And if you give them the space to do things that are, quote unqoute, not burning fires, then they never really learn how to iterate and operate under pressure. I believe I've created a set of individuals within my staff, and within their own team, that actually are better than I am at what they're doing. I'm not the best engineers, engineering data, by far. - Okay, we said it here live. - We said it here live. - (laughs) - I stand by that, as I said before. - No, but it's true, it's true: you can't be great at everything. - I'm not the best AI modeler, or scientist, by far. I'm not the best at thinking about how to do A/B, and all the math and the science behind it. Certainly not. And because you surround yourself with individuals that are capable to do what they're doing. - And smarter than you, in that space. - And smarter than me. So the only thing that you're pointing to them is those blind spots. That they're seeing within their perspectives. You got it, but how 'about this? How 'about that? - And how to go figure it out. - Exactly. And to give them the support to do so. - When you have a foundation in technology your career can take many paths. Your background is statistics. - It is indeed. - And now you're the Chief Data Officer of LinkedIn. - Correct. I mean, that's just like, from Point A to Point B is like a massive change, and a massive evolution. - For me, very early on, I realized that, in order to be good at what I want to do, I don't need to have all the answers. And if I had to pretend that I had all the answers, then it would be actually a detriment. Hence, what I needed to really build, is that belief, and that capacity, and ability in myself to actually learn, and figuring it out. Which then implies, well, keep on learning. Don't stop. - How do you surround yourself with people that have that same mindset to do that, and evolve just the same? - You develop that cocoon, or that space, where you actually let them make their mistakes, and support them when they're making them. And push them into areas where they don't necessarily see. Everybody has blind spots. So you're trying to push them a little bit into those spaces. And the interesting is, it may not necessary just be in the area that you're doing. For example, we are software engineers. You may have a blind spot in humanities. So spend some time. Get your inspiration from a lot of places. It all comes together in the end. Now, when we go to college we say, why do I take that course? It's never going to help me. This is useless. In the end, with a little bit of experience, you realize, actually that's not true, right? All of it is useful. All of it has a little bit of something. - It's like a little piece of foundation to be like, oh, I can build upon that. Or, oh, I remember look at it in that perspective, and doing something different. - So if you take that perspective, building it around you is to making sure that that is there. That's why you build team with diverse backgrounds, diversive perspectives, diverse opinions. So they can all bring that in, to make the whole thing much, much, much better. Innovation occurs more on the outside than inside. Like when you're bringing two things together, compared just like digging in more, and more, and more into your thing. - You might go to school, learn a craft. But you can always evolve to a new craft. And so, everybody's in a different phase of their career. But I want to take you back to when you first started. Little Igor, just out of school. You know, what's some advice that you would give folks? - I think we often ask about, what advice would you give to your 20 year old, or things like that. - Or Little Igor. - Or Little Igor, if you want to become the Big Igor, or whatever. - Oh, you're Big Igor. - Come on! (laughs) - But in the end, I would have said, you know, explore more. Be more curious. Because we tend to worry so much about our careers that I need to shrink it to something, and grow from that. And the problem that when we do this is we're not curious enough about what's around us, and it limits our choices. And in the end, even in the work that we do, we tend to become very rapidly obsolete. So be curious about what is surrounding you all the time. And be open to learn from it. Because inspirations going to hit you from different angles. - And people think that there's this linear path all the time. It's like, I went to school. 'Cause we're so structured, I think, maybe, in the beginning. And then you get out into the real world, and it's like, no. It's this exploration, it's this curiosity. It's this learning mentality. And then you'll figure out where you end up. Thank you, Igor. - Which one, the little or the big one? - (laughs) Big Igor. Authentic leadership: Kathryn Koehler (upbeat music) - In another reality, Katherine Koehler designed racecars for a living. In this one, she's the Director of Engineering for the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative meta-project and science. Leveraging the power of machine learning to democratize scientific research. We're going to talk about how to find your own management style and how to achieve authentic leadership and remain human as a leader. So you have a person in your team and maybe they want to reconstruct the entire system. How do you acknowledge that while not destroying their motivation? I would love to hear your perspective as well because I've had those moments where I am going to shut it down, I will entertain. - Yep. - And I may end up shutting it down as a holistic group thinking exercise with everybody but then sometimes I may have a blind spot. Also and then gosh I'm really glad that I didn't have just that narrow approach because they allowed me to make a different decision too. Has that happened to you as well? - Absolutely and you can't let it go too far, you can't be like anybody else? I'm still waiting to hear all the reasons like, at some point in time you have to make a call and cut the tail off, right? But absolutely, when you are collaborating and thinking with other people, they're bringing things to the table that you couldn't have otherwise considered. And it's super powerful. I hate to say a clich\u00e9: better together, but it's really true. - No it is true and if I'm going to make decisions in a siloed situation, guess what, the odds are I'm going to make the wrong decision but I do think it's important what you had mentioned, at the end of the day someone has to make that decision, they have to make that call but make it be an informed decision but also don't analysis paralysis right? You can keep on analyzing, getting multiple inputs and then you're never going to make a decision. That's also not a healthy thing, you have to figure out where that right balance is. - Yeah and when you've listened to people, they will trust you. They've heard me, right, my leader has heard me. They're not just shutting me down and they don't know what they're missing, yeah. - Got it. (upbeat music) Should you really fake it until you make it? Another thing that you mentioned that, you hear the phrase fake it 'til you make it, type of thing. What is your perspective on that? - Yeah that creates a bit of a visceral response for me. - Let's hear it! I can see it! - Yeah exactly, I really don't like that one. You know, folks tell you hey, fake it 'til you make it, reach for the star and then fake it 'til you make it and a lot of people do go for it and then just wing it and everything but, so say you're starting at a new company and you're the manager and you feel this is a real leap of faith, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm not going to go in there pretending that I know everything and so really confronting what you know, what you don't know, what your strengths are, meeting with everybody on the team, talking through this is my role, this is what you should expect of me. (upbeat music) - Should you do it all? - And one thing I learned which was a really interesting perspective is when you have people reporting to you, they're looking at you like you know what they know plus. Like whatever's the best quality they have, your manager should be that amplified. You can't be that person. - No way. - Nobody's that person, right. So if you confront it head on, you say I'm not going to be your tech lead, I'm not going to be the one doing the hero code reviews and all of the work and building out the architecture but these are the things I am going to be doing for you. And then early on, that trust is in place, you're living, you're walking the talk, you don't have to fake anything. - Someone on your team has made a huge mistake. What do you do? - I have brought down the site. - You did? Good, awesome, good job. That means you are a solid engineer, brought down the site. - For the win! I know, I know. I was in one of the only cellular dead spots in Palo Alto when a weekend event died and we lost all of our customers and my company had to pay a tremendous fine and I go in on Monday and everybody's gilded for battle, they're ready to just rip my head off and I sit down and I go, my fault, I'm accountable, I'm responsible, this is on me, 100%. And it just took all of the air out of the room, everyone's like oh, OK, what are we going to do to fix it in the future? 'Cause it's a team effort, it really is a team effort, right? What kind of metrics could we have in place? What was our backup plan? None of these things were in place. So we failed, right. But it is a team effort and that kind of ownership I think is a good lesson for other people to own up as well. 'Cause if I'd dug in and fought back, no it was that guy's fault, it just would've escalated. - No, it's true. Yeah, it's right, I love the idea of like, owning that you had messed up because we all do but I think the resolution is a team effort, like we start going through maybe we need to audit everything we do, do we have the right in-graphs in place to monitor things, do we have the right alerts. - What was the single point of failure? - What was the single point of failure, so we can just understand that you know, a whole bunch of things have to change because just that one bug happened but actually, when there's one bug there are many. As a leader, you need to be authentic. But you also need to have ownership. (upbeat music) Building diverse teams: Mohak Shroff What's cool about Mohak Shroff is that he started here at LinkedIn as an engineer, and I've learned so much from him throughout the years. He's helped me grow my career, and truly cares about the diversity of thought and representation of multiple perspectives. He knows this will create a better product, and that's what we're going to talk about right now. You started here at LinkedIn as an engineer, and now you're running all of engineering. How do you think about talent and how you're building the team? - So I think it's actually two things. I think there's hiring, and then there's kind of investing your own talent. So there's mentorship and coaching, and we'll talk about both. Hiring should never be about quotas, and like I must have blank. It's about hiring the best person for the job. And the problem that we all have when it comes to hiring is we don't necessarily hire the best person for the job. We hire the first good enough person for the job. And the problem with hiring the first good enough person for the job is we have a systematic problem in educational institutions that are graduating a majority of people with a very homogenous background, you end up hiring a lot of people, or you end up encountering a lot of people with the same background. And then you aren't really hiring the best person, you're tending to hire just the first good person. - Right. - And so I think one thing that has to be changed in the hiring process is demanding that you see a broad slate of candidates, and when I say broad, I mean broad by way of background, broad by way of diversity of thought. You know, people sort of classically go to the idea of diversity is gender, diversity is, you know, ethnicity or what have you. And really I think our diversity is diversity of background, diversity of expertise, diversity of experience. And when you bring that kind of diversity to play, then it naturally does impact other kinds of diversity, the ones we classically think about, but it really builds incredibly powerful teams. And in my personal experience, so I recently had to fill an executive role, as you know, we had a very senior role here that we were attempting to fill. I told our recruiting team I would like to talk to candidates with these backgrounds who aren't what I normally see. And I was blown away because they were the two best candidates I've spoken to in my entire experience as a leader in technology. And it was like where have you been all my life? (laughs) Like, where have you been? - That's awesome. And it turns out I just wasn't asking. - Yeah, and I love the way that you just summarized that because I hear about that, where we want to have a diverse set of candidates that come in, and I go, oh, are we lowering the bar? Oh my gosh, it gets me so frustrated every single time. We're raising the bar, which is absolutely right on, and I think another thing that I like out of that example is you intentionally did that, I remember being part of that process, and I was able to see it, and then I'm hiring folks in my own team, and guess what, I feel empowered to demand the same thing. - And magic, here they are, spectacular. - Does diversity impact decision-making and execution? Raise the bar by empowering others to share diverse ideas. Can you explain to me, I know how it feels, I would love to know from your lens of where you think the conversation has changed here at LinkedIn. - So first off, a testament to the importance of building diverse, inclusive teams is the topics around diversity and inclusion actually start to rise when we had diverse and inclusive leadership. So I remember back to when you joined the team and started pounding your fist on the table very nicely. - Very nicely. (laughs) - It was not so pound, more of sort of like a patting your fist, your palm on the table and saying look, this is a problem both for yourself as well as for many of the women and other people who felt excluded at the company. And if you hadn't been included in the leadership ranks, if your voice hadn't been heard, if we hadn't brought you to LinkedIn none of that would have happened. So I remember years ago, I was in a meeting, we were talking about a fairly technical topic, and it was essentially, as many rooms in technology can be, a room full of men. - Yes, unfortunately, but it's changing slightly. - It's changing, and thank goodness it's changing. But it was a room full of men with one woman leader. The men, myself included, were essentially in an escalating screaming match. So it starts off as a pretty reasonable conversation and it just keeps getting louder, and I want to make sure you hear my voice. And so it starts to get really, really loud. This woman essentially never had a chance to get her voice, you know, just get a word in. - Yeah, try and intercept into that. - Could not at all. And so she was kind of leaned back, sort of the classic picture of disengagement, leaned back, and the leader in the room, incredibly thoughtful, mindful, inclusive individual, in this act of inclusion, leaned in, almost literally leaned in and said, do you have anything to add? Essentially quieted the rest of us down and asked her if she had anything to add. She said her piece, it was about two or three minutes of a point she was trying to make, and in this hour-long meeting the only valuable thing that was said was by her in those two or three minutes. The entire meeting would have been a colossal waste of time if not for letting her speak or pulling her into the conversation. And that act of inclusion had such tremendous power, because it really did three things. One, it made her feel included. I'm positive, prior to that incident, she felt deeply excluded. She felt like she didn't belong. She probably felt a strong imposter syndrome of I can't, I don't know... - I can imagine the war zone going on in her head. And it's not just her, back to the point that it's not just gender, it's more introverts, you know, very different, and extroverts, try and get an introvert into the conversation. - Yes, and so that's exactly, and so like the second thing is that act of inclusion essentially impacted everybody in the room, myself included, where I was like oh! Yeah. If that hadn't happened, we would have made a bad decision. The outcome would have been worse for a lack of inclusion, for a lack of diversity in the conversation. And then the third thing is literally, not only did we learn, but the actual outcome was better. So these things, when you put them together, it's just incredibly powerful what a single act of inclusion can do. - Be an advocate for the voices on your team. Create a space for others to speak. (soft music) Awareness, Synthesis, and Inspiration: Jeff Weiner I work for an amazing CEO. He runs the world's largest and most powerful network of professionals. In the past years, I have been lucky to have moments to lean on Jeff where he's been a mentor, a sponsor, an ally, and simply a true inspiration to me and other leaders in tech. And we're going to talk about it right now. What makes a great leader? - How much time do we have? (Erica laughs) I mean, what makes a great leader? I think there's at least three qualities that make a great leader: awareness, synthesis, and inspiration, people who inspire others. With regard to awareness, I find that the most effective leaders have tremendous sense of awareness. - Okay. - Awareness of the world around them, awareness of their industry, the competitive landscape. They are aware of the strengths and the weaknesses of the people that they work with. They are setting people up to be successful via their strengths. They are coaching them in the areas of improvement. And perhaps most importantly, they are self-aware. - Wow, I love how you started off it being such a macro thing, understanding like the industry and everything around you all the way down to yourself. Because when I think about awareness, oh, my self-awareness, it's the whole thing that matters. - Self-awareness is not just about your interaction with other people. It starts with how you're showing up. - Mmm-hmm. - And one of the things I've found is the ability to be in the moment, the ability to be more mindful, the ability to be a spectator to your own thoughts, especially when you become emotional becomes foundational to a healthy dynamic when it comes to how you're building relationships and how you're establishing trust. That ability is essential to treating people with compassion and putting yourself in their shoes, seeing the way that they view the world, and looking at the world through their perspective for the sake of classically-defined alleviating their suffering. But within a business context, that can be just helping them to achieve them an objective. - As a leader, you need to look at the big picture of the business. - So all of this awareness, if you're doing it properly, is going to result in a lot of information coming at you. - [Erica] It makes sense. - A lot of information. And how do you separate the signal from the noise? You have to take the time to connect the dots and figure out what matters and what doesn't matter. As a matter of fact, that brings me to the second pillar of what I look for in effective leaders, and that's synthesis. You have to have a very clear understanding of what it is you're trying to accomplish, how you're trying to accomplish it, and use this information to accomplish your objectives, to accomplish your goals and do it in the most productive, effective, efficient way possible. So it's not just about being aware. - No. - You can be aware, and you can become completely inundated by all of this information, by all of this data, by all this knowledge. It's what you do with it. - [Erica] Mmm-hmm. - That is ultimately going to enable you to create value from it. - It's almost like building technology. It's like you have all this information. You have all this data. What are you going to do with this data? And then your third point of like inspiration, it's really about scale. And how do you scale that out to everybody else? I mean, that's how my brain works as an engineer. - [Jeff] Yeah, yeah. I think that's exactly right. - [Erica] Putting this all together. - I hadn't necessarily thought about it in those terms. I think that makes a ton of sense. You're going from one person, yourself. All of the stuff is coming at you, and you're collecting the information to framing it in a way that allows you to effectively communicate it to others so other people can take action, and then inspiring them to do so. - [Erica] Yeah. - Yeah, so that is the way to maximize scale. - Yeah. Everyone needs mentors along the way to the top. Everybody wants you at every single fireside chat that we have across the company because you're there and you have an element about you where you just inspire everyone around you. I wonder, how do you do that? - And that's the last of the three pillars is how you compel others to take action. For me, the definition of leadership is the ability to inspire others to achieve shared objectives. And inspiration is by far and away the most important word in that definition. And to me, inspiration is what separates leaders from managers. Managers tell people what to do. Leaders inspire them to do it. I think inspiration comes from three qualities, three dimensions. One is the clarity of one's vision. The second is the courage of one's convictions. And the third is to effectively communicate both of those things. It starts with the clarity of your vision because if you are going to try to tackle something that hasn't been done before, it's important that you are able to articulate that in a way that other people can internalize and other people can act upon it. Beyond the clarity of one's vision is the courage of your conviction, because if it's truly visionary, if you're trying to do something that hasn't been done before, there's going to be a lot of people standing in your way. They're going to feel threatened. They're not going to understand. They're going to be skeptical. You have to believe with every fiber of your being. - [Erica] Mmm-hmm. - In what it is that you're trying to accomplish because if you don't, why would anyone else? - No one, yeah, why would they? - And interestingly enough, other people can sense a lack of conviction a mile away. - [Erica] Wow. - You can say the right words, but if you're not feeling it? - [Erica] Feeling it, it doesn't matter. - It's not going to matter. And that brings me to the last point which is the ability to effectively communicate both the clarity of your vision and the courage of your conviction. You can do it through words. You can do it through deeds. Or ideally, you can do it through both. - Got it. You have to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. Be approachable. Be there for your team.","title":"Leadtech"},{"location":"blogs/lead/stories/","text":"Give a quick 1 sentence summary Provide context behind your story Talk about your role in the situation Share the outcome and results Share what you learned Give the interviewer opportunities to ask questions VT - Initiative, Challenge, Target started paying for a vendor service called voice transcript but not leveraging it.

And the first and most important part of being a great storyteller is knowing what stories to tell. Hi, I'm Paul Smith, author of the book The 10 Stories Great Leaders Tell. There are a lot of resources out there to help you craft better stories at work, and I spent most of my professional time doing exactly that. But that's not the first question most leaders ask. The first question is usually what stories do I need to tell? And that's the right first question because if you're not telling the right stories, it doesn't matter how well you tell them. So after working with thousands of leaders and conducting literally hundreds of one-on-one interviews with CEOs and executives in 25 countries around the world, I've put together a list of the most important 10 stories I think every leader needs to be able to tell at a moment's notice. And when I say a story, I don't just mean a well-articulate opinion about these topics. You should have that to, of course. What I mean is that for each one, you should have a unique narrative about something interesting that actually happened to someone that will help everyone in your organization understand your concept on a personal, visceral level. So in this course, I'll be sharing an example of each story along with some tips on how you can come up with similar stories of your own. Let's get started. The 10 stories every leader should tell In my work on storytelling business I've documented over 3000 individual stories and I think the number of different types of stories a good leader could tell is nearly limitless. But to help leaders focus on the most important ones I decided to pick the top ten and here's the criteria I used first, I included the kinds of stories leaders most often ask me for help with. Second, I chose stories in areas where every leader should be exerting some influence in the organization. Third, I looked for stories that would be useful to leaders in just about any functional discipline from general management to marketing, sales, finance, HR, IT, engineering, whatever. And last, I looked for stories that won't need to change very often. So you can get a lot of mileage out of each one. Okay here's the list of ten stories. And the first four go together because they're about setting direction for the company, so here are those four. Where we came from, a founding story. Why we can't stay there, a case for change story. Where we're going, a vision story. And how we're going to get there, a strategy story. Now the next four go together as well but they're more about who we are as an organization. What we believe, a corporate values story. Who we serve, a customer story. What we do for our customers, a sales story. And how we're different from our competitors, a marketing story. Okay the last two are a little bit more personal. Why I lead the way I do, a personal leadership philosophy story. And why you should want to work here, a recruiting story. So there they are, the ten stories every leader should be able to tell. Let's dive in. Where we came from (our founding story) Nobody ever quit their job, risked everything and started their own company for a boring reason, and that's why you should be telling your company's founding story. It's probably exciting, and sharing a great founding story gives employees a chance to be part of something bigger than their job. It shows them the passion and drive behind why the founder started the company in the first place, so that they can have the same sense of passion. Now, here's an example. In the late 1980s, Gary Erickson was living in a San Francisco Bay Area trying to hold down two jobs. Now, during the day, he was managing a bicycle seat manufacturing company, but at night, he was pursuing his real passion, running his own bakery. Well, one day in 1990, he was out for 175 mile day-long bike ride with a friend, and as most bikers do, he'd brought up half dozen energy bars with him for refueling along the route. Well, anyway, they got to the top of Mount Hamilton, just east of San Jose, and they took a break. Now, Gary had already eaten five of his six bars, but he was still famished, and he had 50 miles left to go. Well, he looked at the sixth one in his hand, and he thought, no way. I can't do one more. I'd rather starve than eat another one of these. Now, if you're familiar with some of those early energy bars, you understand why. They were hard and sticky and just kind of sat in your stomach like a rock. Well, as he was coasting back down into San Jose on an empty stomach, Gary was thinking to himself, wait a minute, I've got a bakery and everything we make tastes great, Why we can't stay there (a case-for-change story) Human beings are creatures of habit, and that means change is hard. And without a compelling human reason, people won't adapt quickly or effectively to whatever change you've got planned. A case for change story gives them that reason why. And the best story to answer that question will be one about whoever stands to benefit most from the change. So here's an example. In February 2015, NPR aired a story about Joey, a 10-year-old boy in Gainseville, Florida, who suffered from a rare form of kidney cancer. Now when Joey was diagnosed in March 2013, the cancer had already spread to his stomach and his chest and his neck, and he went through two surgeries and five rounds of chemotherapy. None of which worked for more than a month or two. Well, eventually, he'd exhausted all the treatments available. Well, by the fall of 2014, with no remaining treatment options, the doctors told his mother, Kathy, to just take Joey home and enjoy their remaining time together. So Kathy was desperate. She said we can't just go home. For us, that means giving up. Well, then in September, the FDA approved a new drug called Keytruda, made by Merck. So Kathy called doctors across the country to find one willing to use it on a 10-year-old boy. And she found one in Cincinnati. So Kathy, her husband, their three-year-old, and Joey all packed their things in Florida and moved to Cincinnati. Now Joey got that first injection of Keytruda on October 14, over a year and a half after being diagnosed. Now the good news was that the tumors in his neck started to shrink immediately, and the ones in the rest of his body at least stabilized, but Joey was already weak when the treatment started, and the cancer had an 18-month head start. Well, six weeks later, the day before Thanksgiving, Joey passed away. Now Kathy told the reporters, if Joey could've just gotten this drug last year, even just a couple of months earlier, maybe it would've been a different story. Now when that story aired on NPR, one of the people who heard it worked at a company that had just retained me as their storytelling coach. And the industry they worked in also produced life-saving products, but that also took a notoriously long time to get to market, sometimes a decade or more. So like most of their competitors, one of the things they were working on was how to get products to market faster. But changing a complex, decade-long process is hard work. And trying to motivate the employees by telling them how much more money the company would make just wasn't working. My job was to help them develop a case for change story. And when the person in my workshop shared NPR's story of Kathy and Joey, it immediately became the basis for their story, their case for change. Now think about that. Keytruda wasn't their product, and Joey wasn't their customer, but it did become their story, or at least a fictionalized version of it because they knew the same thing was surely happening with the life-saving products that they were working on. And having a human reason to do all this hard work was a more effective motivator than higher profits and a growing stock price. So to come up with your own case for change story, start by asking yourself who stands to benefit from this change. Surely, it's good for someone or it wouldn't be a priority for the company, right? Now once you know who that is, talk to them and ask these kinds of questions, what's your life or work like today prior to making this change? What problems or frustrations do you have? Or how would your life or work be different once you implement the change? And then what are the tangible ways you know the change is working? Now sure, not everyone will have a story as compelling as Kathy and Joey because not everyone's job is curing cancer. But whatever it is that you and your company are trying to do with this change will surely benefit someone. Find them, and that will be your case for change. Where we're going (a vision story) A vision is a picture of the future so compelling, people want to go there with you. In other words, a story about the future. Now unfortunately, what passes for a vision today is often just a vision sentence or a phrase like 20% market share by 2020. Seriously? That's a goal, not a vision. And here's a better way that I stumbled across myself. In 2002, I was asked to lead a group of forecasters who's job it was to predict the future sales of new products. But, since you can't predict the future perfectly, they knew their predictions were always going to be wrong. They just didn't know if it'd be too high or too low and by how much. Well, to make matters worse, they were often under trained, had forecasting models that were overly complicated or poorly documented and based on old data. Now my job was to lead them through whatever changes were needed to fix all that. But the solution wasn't something that I could just do for them; it would take a lot of work on their part. My challenge was to lay out a vision and hopefully inspire enough of them to do the hard work necessary to get there. So I wrote them a vision story and it stared out like this: below is a picture of the future. It's my vision of what a day in the life of a sales forecaster could be in the near future. Now, some of you may feel you're already pretty close to this and some may feel infinitely far away. Either way, I want to make this a vision that we all share, either by adding your ideas to it or embracing it as is, let me know what you think. And in the subject line of the email, I wrote, the vision: a day in the life of a sales forecaster. And the story it contained introduced Sheri, a sales forecaster two years in the future. And then the story simply followed Sheri through a single day at work. What she did, and the meetings she attended, and for the people reading it, it was clear how different her experience was from what they experienced day to day. You know, the story followed Sheri to meetings that she previously wouldn't have even been invited to because her opinion wasn't valued as much before. And then, instead of feeling uncertain when she answered questions in a meeting, she felt confident, because she'd been more properly trained and her models were updated with the most recent data. And instead of fumbling around in her forecast model, trying to figure out how it worked and troubleshooting issues, she simply opened the new instruction manual and followed the instructions. And as the story continued, it became clear that she experienced none of the typical frustrations a forecaster would be familiar with. And then the story closed at the end of the day when Sheri was walking out of a meeting. You know, two people thanked her for her great ideas and said that they really liked this new leadership role the forecasters seemed to be playing in the business. And the final words of the story read, she hadn't realized it before now, but she actually liked her job. It was a lot more fun to come to work when you know what you're doing and that you're having a positive impact on the results. Now, the first response I got to the email was, oh wow, I want that to be my story two years from now. I'm in. Well after a dozen or so responses like that, I knew I'd stumbled upon something right with the story. So to craft a vision story of your own, start by deciding who will benefit most if you vision is achieved. Then choose a fictional character from that group to be the main character of your story and then just sketch out what a typical day at work will be like for them after your vision has been achieved. You know, make sure to include the type of activities that are both important to your audience and heavily impacted by having achieved the vision. You know, if your goal is winning in the marketplace, what's better about that? Will employees be prouder to work there? If so, then maybe show your main character reading a flattering article about your company in Fortune magazine. You know, if you goal is to grow sales and profits faster, what's better about that? Will that mean bigger bonuses? Will it open up new job opportunities for your employees or create more challenging work? Show that in the story. And then, conclude with a summary of how your main character feels about the world he or she is living in and working in now compared to the way things were before and that's your vision story. How we're going to get there (a strategy story) Strategy is how you get from where you are now to where you want to be. In other words, a strategy is a journey. And what better way to describe a journey than a story? Here's a creative example I came across. The cough cold industry is a seasonal business. You know, the overwhelming majority of cold medicines and cough syrups and and facial tissues are sold either in the winter cold season or the spring allergy season. And like a lot of businesses, there's usually one dominant brand and then a distant second, and third place brand. Well, one year all the employees, at one of those second place brands got to work one morning, to find something unexpected on their desks. A copy of what looked like an article from the Wall Street Journal, except it wasn't really a journal article. It was just a memo designed to look like one. And strangely, the date at the top was six years in the future. And the title was how David beat Goliath. And here's the gist of what it said. It introduced a guy named Vavec whose 12 year old daughter, had just signed up to play basketball on a team with a bunch of girls, who'd never played the game and who had no coach. Now he knew they didn't have much of a chance of winning a game even with a coach and none without. So he volunteered. Now, they ended up in the national championships, how? They changed the game. Instead of conventional basketball, they ran a full court press every game all the time. Now, why did that work? It worked because when you're the underdog, letting your opponent play the game that they trained for is a sure path to losing. Vavex opponents had very little practice against a full court press. And when they did get the ball, close enough to the goal to make a play, they were too exhausted to run to their place. And that's exactly what the second tier brand, in the cough cold category did that year. They took place right out of Vavex playbook. Instead of only running ads during cough, cold and allergy season, they started advertising 12 months a year. The ground they picked up in off-peak, gave them a head start the next peak season. They also stopped marketing their brands as only good for colds and allergies. For example, you can use facial tissues to remove makeup or wipe away tears, not just blow your nose. And while most brands market their products exclusively to women, they started advertising to men also. All those new users and new buyers grew their market share even more. Well, the final line in the article, said that after five years of executing these strategies, this distant little second place brand, had just overtaken the dominant brand in market share, for the first time in its 50 year history. David 37%, Goliath 36%. And then at the bottom of the article, was a handwritten note that said, \"Thanks for everything you did to achieve these amazing results,\" signed the boss. Now, yes, because it was dated in the future, you could consider this a vision story but make no mistake, this was a strategy story. It explained each piece of the brand strategy and why each one would work. Using layman's terms and a brilliant's analogy and an inspiring story. Well, by the afternoon, people all over the office, had pinned that article to their cubicle walls, because for the first time, they finally understood the strategy in a way that they could understand, appreciate, and most importantly, execute. A well crafted strategy story can do the same for you. So, to try this particular execution, pick a date in the future, by which your strategy should have worked. And then write what amounts to a newspaper or a magazine article, looking back at your success. And include all the metrics of success, like revenues, and profits and market share whatever, and describe each component of your strategy, in terms of how it played out and how it impacted your business results versus your competitors. Now, you certainly don't need to use a sports analogy, and it doesn't have to be a story looking back from the future. It can just be a hypothetical story delivered in present tense, starting with, \"Imagine this,\" and then follow that with the journey to take you where you want to go. And that becomes your strategy story. What we believe (a corporate values story) Every company has them, corporate value statements. Now, sometimes they're called company values and principles, or simply, what we believe. But values are only words on a piece of paper until they're tested, until someone is put in a difficult position of choosing between doing the hard right or the easy wrong. Now, that's why stories are uniquely called for when trying to establish values in an organization. Only a story can convey the uncomfortable or awkward predicament required to truly define a value. So, here's an example. It's likely that you've heard of Sam Walton who founded Walmart in 1962 in Arkansas, but you may not be familiar with Florence Butt, the woman who founded H.E. Butt, or H-E-B, grocery stores in San Antonio, Texas in 1905. Now, for much of the 20th century, H-E-B was the largest grocery store chain in Texas. That is, until Walmart came along. And then within a couple of decades, Walmart had overtaken H-E-B as the leading grocer in Texas. Well, by that time, Charles Butt, the grandson of the founder, was the CEO of the company, and in an effort to learn from his now larger competitor, Charles Butt once asked Sam Walton if he could bring his leadership team to Walmart's headquarters on a learning mission. Now, that probably seems kind of weird since they're obviously competitors, but Sam Walton agreed to do it anyway. So, on a scheduled day, Charles Butt and his whole executive team arrived in Arkansas and met Sam at one of his local stores. Well, when Charles walked in, he could see Sam at the end of a long aisle talking to a customer, so Charles walked up the aisle with his team. Well, when Sam saw him, he stopped them and said, Charles, I'll be with you in a minute. I'm talking to this young woman. He was trying to sell her an ironing board cover. And after a few more minutes of conversation, the woman put one of the ironing board covers in her cart and pushed off to the register. Sam then turned to Charles and asked him, in all seriousness, Charles, do you know how many worn out ironing board covers there are in this country? We're going to sell one million of them this month. Now, imagine you're an employee at Walmart today and your boss told you that story. What lessons about company values could you learn? Here's my list. First, other retailers are our competitors, not our enemies. We work in the same industry serving the same customers. You know, if we can help each other serve those customers without giving away our competitive secrets, we should. Second, the customer is number one. You know, even though he'd invited H-E-B's CEO to fly hundreds of miles just to meet with him, Sam Walton chose to make the CEO wait while he helped a customer. Third, understanding the customer's wants and needs is important. How do you think Sam knew there were so many worn out ironing board covers in the country? He asked. Okay, fourth, persistence pays off. Valuing persistence means you don't give up until you've helped the customer find what he or she is looking for. Sam didn't quit until the woman was satisfied with her choice and put the ironing board cover in her cart. And last, passion wins. Out of the billions of dollars in merchandise Walmart sells every year, Sam had set a goal specifically for how many ironing board covers he wanted to sell, a million this month, and he was clearly excited by the challenge. Passion is contagious. Spread it, and you'll be amazed what you can accomplish. So, notice that a story like this can communicate not just one, but a number of different values at the same time, and it does so far better than a corporate value statement ever could. So, to come up with your own value stories, start by finding your company value statement. It's probably hidden in a dusty drawer somewhere. Go through each item on the list and ask these questions. When have I seen someone's behavior exemplify this value? What happened, and how did it reflect on that person and the company? Or, when have I seen someone's behavior show the opposite character? What happened, and what were the negative consequences for that person and the company? And then, pick the situation that best illustrates the value or values most important to you personally. Build a story around that moment, share it, and ask people what values they learn from it but before telling them what you learned from it. Chances are, they'll learn the same thing you did. Who we serve (a customer story) A desk is a dangerous place from which to view the world. That's the observation of a spy novelist named John le Carre. But it's just as fitting in the business world. You know if the only customer information used in your organization comes from dry Powerpoint presentations and impersonal statistical data, you probably don't understand your customer any more than you understand your own medical charts. No, there's just no substitute for getting out of the office and meeting your customer face-to-face. But since not everyone in the company can do that as often as they should, you, as the leader should be telling the stories of the people who did. Especially the truly enlightened ones. So, here's an example. In 1993, Rohini was a new marketing manager for a brand of disposable feminine hygiene pads in India. And she was on a three-day trip in Chennai doing in-home research. And her goal was to find out what was causing low-income women to buy her expensive brand of disposable pads when they had been using cheap, reusable cloth pads. And, one of those in-home visits was in a two-room apartment with a small kitchen alcove, no TV, no refrigerator, and no air conditioning. You know a man's shirt was hanging from two nails on the other side of the door along with his trousers and a towel. And on the table, under the window, was a pile of schoolbooks covered in brown paper. Now, she described their conversation this way. Early on in the discussion it became clear that she wasn't using our product for herself, she was buying it for her eighth grade daughter who'd been using cloth. So, I asked her why she'd started spending money on it if her daughter had already become used to cloth. And the woman replied, well, it's because she has to go to school. Well, what did your daughter do about school when she was using cloth? Oh, she would go, all right, but she just felt uncomfortable, you know couldn't concentrate. But with these pads, she doesn't feel the wetness so she feels more comfortable and she doesn't have to worry about staining. But don't you think that's a bit expensive for you just to give your daughter a comfortable feeling every once in awhile? Oh yes, it's expensive, she said, but she needs to be able to concentrate in school to get good marks. So Rohini asked, well, why is that important? After all, you'll presumably just want to get her married after school, so why are good marks important? And the woman said, well, I want her to study further after school. I don't want her to get married too early. Well, but you, yourself got married at the age of 16. What's wrong with that? And then the woman leaned forward in her chair and she looked Rohini right in the eyes and said, I don't want my daughter to be like me. I want my daughter to be financially independent, to be able to be comfortable in the outside world. You know whether she marries or not will be up to her. She has to study, get good marks, and go to college and then get a job. I don't want her to have two kids by the age of 20. You know, I live my life through my children. I don't have many aspirations for my own life now, but my daughter must be different from me. And that's why these pads make sense. Now, no doubt Rohini's team wrote a proper, clinical summary of their conclusions and observations on that research trip. But the most effective vehicle she left for helping others understand the customer was the intimate portrait contained in the story about meeting that one woman in Chennai. So, to come up with your own customer stories, do this. First, get out of the office and meet your customer face-to-face. Go on a sales call with the sales team, tag along with the research department on a customer visit, stop a shopper in the aisle at a grocery store when you see them buying your product. Whatever you have to do, make it happen. Then, when you get back, write a story about your experience and what you learned. In fact, ask other leaders about their personal experiences with consumers and cuatomers. Somebody has a great customer story like Rohini's. Find it and tell that story. What we do for our customers (a sales story) Have you ever listened to someone explain what they do for a living, after which you didn't have the slightest clue what they actually did? Of course you have. It might sound something like this: I run a company that integrates siloed marketing platforms into a single digital information exchange. You know, what does that even mean? Now, perhaps some of you are even thinking that sometimes the person spewing out those meaningless buzzwords is you. And that's one reason you need at least one good story to help explain in concrete terms what it is you or your company does for your customers. All right, here's an example. Ben Koberna is the founder and CEO of a reverse auction company. That means it finds and condenses several suppliers to participate in a competitive bidding process to supply whatever it is the client needs at the cheapest cost. And while that short description does accurately describe what his company does, it leaves all kinds of questions unanswered. So, when he's talkin' to a new prospect, he almost always tells the story about one of his very first clients. Now, it was a mid-size city government in Central Florida. And they'd been paying $250,000 a year for a contractor to haul away the sludge from their wastewater treatment plant. So, they hired his company to do a reverse auction to see if they could save some money. He explained what they did this way. He said, we looked around and found several sludge-removal companies that were interested. Then we invited them to a pre-bid meeting, so we could explain the process. Well, the guy who had the contract at the time showed up with his layer, yelling and screaming, and he even kicked over a chair. I mean, he told us the whole process was illegal and said we were all going to be arrested. Well, we eventually got him settled down and started the bidding process. So, his first bid was for $250,000, of course. But then, when more aggressive bids started coming in, he lowered his bid to 240,000, and then 200,000, and then 150,000. The next bid he put in, though, was for zero dollars. Now, obviously, that was a mistake, so we paused the auction and called him on the phone. We explained his mistake and told him we could strike that bid and reset the auction. But he told us that wouldn't be necessary. He said, \"I didn't make a mistake. \"I've been sellin' that sludge to local farmers \"for the last 20 years to use as fertilizer. \"I'll just come pick it up for free.\" And my client has been saving $250,000 a year ever since. Now, notice how Ben's story answers a lot of questions his customers ask, and even some they don't even know to ask or are afraid to ask. For example, the story answers questions like, do I have to find all the vendors to bid? Nope, that's our job. And how do we explain to them how the process will work? You don't, we do that for you in a pre-bid meeting. But it also answers this more uncomfortable question: Will my current supplier get mad at me for doing this? Because the truth is, in Ben's experience, they will get mad. And most clients will worry about that because they've been doing business with these people for years. They know them personally. And nobody wants to upset someone you've known and worked with for a long time. But as the story illustrates, it doesn't matter if they get upset because they won't get mad at the client, they're going to get mad at Ben. That's part of what the client is paying for, for his company to shoulder the brunt of the emotional reaction this kind of a process creates. All the client has to do is save money. Okay, if you have personal experience workin' with customers, you might be able to craft this story by yourself. If not, you'll need the help of someone in the sales department. They probably even have stories like this they can tell you off the top of their head. Share this story with them as an example of what you're looking for. And then do the following: First, choose a client from a typical industry you serve, preferably one with a great experience working with you. And you don't have to use the client's real name. Next, sketch out a brief outline of events that led up to them needing your product or service. It has to be a specific instance. Then list the main steps of what your company did for them, all right? And then last, explain the outcome in terms of how it benefited the customer. That's it, that's your sales story. How we're different from our competitors (a marketing story) Marketing is about differentiation. It communicates how your product or service is different from your competitors. And marketers use all kinds of methods to communicate that differentiation, like television commercials and product demos and samples sent to your home. But as a leader, whether you're talking to a perspective customer, the investment community, or just helping the people in your department appreciate why your company's product is better than your competition, your best tool is a story. Okay, here's an example. Sharad Madison is the CEO of the commercial cleaning company United Building Maintenance. They're the ones that come in and clean your offices at night. Now when Sharad is trying to explain how his company is different from his competitors he often tells the following story about what he does when he acquires a new client. He says, when we take over a new contract we typically have a 30 day transition period. We take that time to go into the building in the middle of the night to see how they're cleaning it now, to find out if they're properly trained and have the right tools. For example, we recently took over the contract for the Verizon building in New Jersey. Now that's a 1.7 million square foot property across multiple buildings. So we went in and found a guy vacuuming the carpet. Now it turns out he was using the same kind of residential quality vacuum cleaner you probably use at home. Now those hallways are 12 feet wide and over 1/2 a mile long. Can you imagine trying to clean the whole thing with the same machine you use at home? It could take a week and it probably still wouldn't be very clean. Plus, that vacuum will have to be replaced every few months. Well, we ordered him a triple wide industrial strength vacuum cleaner that'll do the job in less than half the time and last forever. Well, then we went to another floor and we found someone shampooing those same carpets with a regular walk behind squeeze bottle shampooer. Again, that could take all night just to shampoo that one floor. So we put him into a high speed riding shampooer that could do the job in a fraction of the time with much better results. Plus, it gets the guy off his feet, so I have fewer workman's comp issues and so does my client. Well, then we got to the offices and started looking at the top of the file cabinets. And you could see half moons swiped out on top of them and he said, I know exactly what that meant. Those cabinets were 5 1/2 feet tall and several of the people cleaning them were shorter than that. So it's not that they're lazy, they just literally couldn't reach high enough to clean all the way to the back. So when we took over we gave them all these little plastic extension wands that they could reach all the way to the back with. Problem solved. Now compare that story to how Sharad might explain his points of differentiation if he was using one of the more typical features and benefits type of marketing language. It'd sound something like this, you know what makes us different is that we equip our cleaners with triple wide industrial strength vacuum cleaners, high speed riding shampooers, and extension wands for dusting, and that's how we're different. Now that, of course, all is true, those are the facts, but the story is far more compelling, because with the story the listener can see all those pieces of equipment in use. They can see the guy going from the cheap vacuum cleaner to the triple wide one. They can picture the guy riding around on a shampooer like the Zamboni driver on an ice skating rink. They can see very clearly someone easily cleaning all the way to the back of a tall, dusty cabinet with a plastic extension wand. Okay, here's some tips to help you craft your own marketing story. Ask the following questions, and you might need to get some input from the sales or marketing or research departments to find good answers. All right, first, think of a time that you or someone else used one of your competitor's products or services and had a bad experience. What was that experience like? And how does it differ from an experience with your product? Okay, second, think of some of the most positive customer success stories at your company. What was so fabulous about them that isn't likely to happen with your competitor's products? And last, and this is my favorite, talk to some of your customers who used to use your competitor's products, but have switched to you. What about their experience made them switch? And what's it like now with your product? Okay, choose one of those experiences and craft a story around it that illustrates the difference between your product or service and your competitors. It could simply be two stories told back to back. A bad customer experience with your competitor's product and a good customer experience with your product. That's your marketing story. Why I lead the way I do (a leadership philosophy story) Have you ever met with someone at work and they handed you a sheet of paper that lays out the leadership principles they operate by? Yeah, I've always been impressed with people forward thinking enough to have their own personal leadership philosophy, but I'm rarely impressed with what that philosophy actually is. You know, it's usually just a bunch of trite platitudes and meaningless buzzwords that sounds something like this: my leadership philosophy is to synergistically leverage my organizations unique capabilities and value added activities to drive employee engagement, outside the box thinking, and ultimately maximize value creation. No, ah! I mean, that is so vague and impersonal, I could've taken any of the dozens I've been handed in the past and switched the names at the top and it would not have made a difference. All right, a bunch of buzzwords on a piece of paper, could never adequately articulate the subtle, complex, and human nature of leadership. You know, the only thing capable of that kind of finesse, is a story, or more likely, several stories, but let's start with one. So, in 1995, Mike Figliuolo was a tank platoon leader in the US Army, in charge of 15 soldiers and four tanks. Well in April of that year, his platoon was getting ready for a field training exercise, so essentially it was a war game with real tanks and a real field, but with simulated weapons. So it was basically a game of laser tag with tanks and as fate would have it, Mike's tank would literally be the first tank among 400 vehicles going into battle in wedge formation on his side of the field. Now, before the exercise, Mike and his commanding officer had looked at a, at the map of the field. And there were several hills and they decided on one particular pass between them that would be the safest and the fastest route. So, when the game started, Mike's tank, of course, sped toward the enemy as planned, but a battlefield rarely looks like it does on a map, especially when you're looking at it through the tiny opening in a hatch while moving 40 miles per hour and being shot at. So, when they got to the hills, Mike wasn't sure which way to go so he had a decision to make. Now option one, he could stop the tank, pull out the map, and figure out the right way to go. But, the tanks were all in a very tight formation and all of them would have to stop with him and that would leave them all sitting in the open, subject to enemy fire, all right. Option two, he could make an educated guess, keep moving forward, and take his chances. Mike chose option two. He yelled out, \"Driver go left, take the left pass.\" Less than a minute late, Mike's tank got taken out by a laser. And a few seconds later, his wingman got taken out as well as the third tank, but the fourth tank, and all the other 396 tanks in the battalion saw what happened and realized it was the wrong decision. All of them headed right, flooded through the correct pass and won the battle. Now, it was an important lesson for Mike. It taught him the value of decisiveness. You know, in war, and in business, it's often better to make the wrong decision quickly, then to make the right decision slowly. You know, bad decisions usually become evident before too long and can be corrected. But indecision can cost you the battle because while you're studying the problem, your opponents are still moving forward. So, now as a business leader, he rarely falls victim to the analysis paralysis that troubles so many leaders today. You know, by comparison, his decisions can seem quick, but he also has a higher tolerance for mistakes, as long as people learn from those mistakes and sharing his story of that field training exercise is one way he helps his partners and clients expect that kind of decisive leadership behavior from him and plan accordingly. And a story like that, of your own, can do the same for you. So, to look for personally defining moments, like this, in your life as a leader, ask yourself these questions: what was your biggest leadership mistake and what did you learn from it? What leadership decision are you most proud of and why? What leader do you most admire and what was the moment your realized you did? And what one or two principles are you least willing to sacrifice to achieve your goals and why? So, pick one of the moments you thought of from that list of questions and build a story around it. That will be your personal leadership philosophy story. Why you should want to work here (a recruiting story) If you've ever been to a job fair, you've seen this yourself. Go up to any of the booths and ask the recruiter why you should want to work at their company. I can tell you the answers you'll get. Competitive pay and benefits, challenging jobs, a chance to work with smart people, and great opportunities for advancement. And if the job fair's in Silicon Valley, you'll also hear about the free lunch and the foosball table in the break room. Now, then go to the next booth, and ask the same question. Right, you'll get the same answer, and that's why you need a recruiting story. After hearing about the salary and the other basics, human beings need a human reason to make a decision as important as what company to work for. That story could help them understand what it's really like to work there. It could illustrate a unique and creative way someone made the decision to take the job or it could be a surprising reason why someone chose to stay working at your company, instead of quitting like they'd planned. Now, no matter which it is, it's something that you, as the leader, can give them that's not in the brochure. Here's an example. In the spring of '93, I was just finishing my MBA. I'd already been through a dozen job interviews and was trying to decide what to do next. Now, I was fortunate that the job market was strong that year, so I ended up with several offers, and with companies like Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble, it was going to be a tough decision. All of them had roughly the same compensation and benefits, and even the career paths and job assignments were remarkably similar. I was a bit stumped. I pulled out the phone book, and I called an executive search firm. Now, I told the first person who would talk to me that I didn't need their services yet, but that I still wanted their advice. I told the guy on the other end of the line my situation. New MBA grad, multiple job offers, etc. I gave him the names of all the companies and all the jobs and all the salaries that I'd been offered. And then I asked him this question. I said, \"If I called you five years from now, \"and wanted to move to a new company, \"which of these companies \"would you find it easiest to place me from?\" And then, without hesitating, the guy said, \"Oh, Procter & Gamble.\" I said, \"Well, how can you be so sure?\" He said, \"Two reasons. \"First, I place people into and out of all those companies \"all the time. \"And then after a year, \"I call them up and ask them how things are going. \"For the people I place out of P&G into other companies, \"I consistently hear this complaint. \"'It's good here, but the people just aren't as talented \"as I was used to working with at P&G.' \"And I rarely heard that complaint in the other direction.\" \"And the second reason?\" I asked? He said, \"Because P&G is still \"a promote from within company, and none of the others are. \"That means they only hire people at the entry-level. \"I can get you a job at any of those other companies \"any time you want, but if you ever want to work at P&G, \"you'll have to do it now.\" I started my job at P&G in June, and that three-minute phone call with a head hunter was the reason why. Now, for the next several years, anytime I found myself on the P&G recruiting team headed back to my alma mater to woo the next round of MBA graduates, I brought that story with me. Now, it certainly didn't replace the flashy PowerPoint presentations and expensive dinner budgets, and it didn't replace the talking points and list of reasons to come work at P&G, but a lot of companies give the same reasons. Having one more person on the recruiting team repeat that list doesn't help much. But the story was unique. It articulated real points of difference and it allowed the listener to consider making the same phone call I did, not just take my word for it. Okay, tips to help you craft your own recruiting story. Ask yourself, and the people you work with, these three questions. What made you want to come work here? Why do you stay? And have you ever thought about quitting, but decided not to? If so, what made you change your mind? Now, keep asking until you come across a great story. Not everyone will have one, but somebody will. Next steps So there you have the 10 stories that every leader needs to be able to tell and if you haven't already, it's time to start finding and crafting your own and you can start by just searching your own past for stories similar to the ones you heard here but don't stop there. Get stories from other people. Try holding a contest and giving away a prize for the best story. Solicit customer stories on your website and offer an incentive to share. Share this list of stories with your coworkers and family and friends, really anyone who might have a great story. You'll be surprised how willing people are to share their stories when they know you're looking for one. Now, once you find a story, don't just take it and use it the way you heard it. Chances are you can do much better. These really are the most important stories that any leader will ever tell. It's worthwhile to spend a little time refining it so that it's as compelling, memorable and effective as it can be. Now, to learn how to do that, you'll want to check out one of my other courses here on LinkedIn Learning called Leading with Stories. You'll learn how to use the right story structure, create the right level of emotional engagement and keep the story interesting and memorable with the element of surprise.

Best of luck with your leadership stories. Addressing leadership with story Here's one of the dirtiest little secrets in the leadership business, bossing people around has never really worked that well. You know wagging your finger at someone and telling them what to do just isn't the most effective way to get the kind of performance and teamwork you want. I mean sure it can sometimes work in the short term but long term that kind of autocratic management style just leads to resentment. You know a far better method is to inspire your organization to want to do what you want them to do and the best tool you have to do that is storytelling. Which is exactly what this course will do for you, teach you how to craft compelling leadership stories. My name is Paul Smith and I'm a leadership and storytelling trainer and author of the bestselling book Lead with a Story. Now I've interviewed hundreds of CEOs and executives at dozens of companies around the world to uncover what leadership stories you need and how to tell them. In this course we'll start by understanding what a leadership story is and why storytelling works so well as a leadership tool. Then we'll explore the most important types of stories leaders should be telling. But we'll spend most of our time in this course exploring how to craft these stories. Including a simple story structure and techniques to create the right level of emotion and even a surprise ending. This course will help you tell better leadership stories. Let's get started. What a leadership story is and is not Just because you can give a good speech or make a good presentation, doesn't mean you can tell a good story. You know, not every compelling set of words that comes out of your mouth is a story. A story is something special. Now, stated simply, a story is a narrative about something interesting that happened to someone. Now, what that means is a real story will have these six attributes. A time, a place, a main character, that main character will have a goal, there'll be an obstacle getting in the way of that goal, and there should be events that transpire along the way and resolve themselves nicely in the end. Now, to help you tell the difference between an actual leadership story and other kinds of communication, I put a short quiz in the exercise files for this course. Now, it has three short narratives, and your job is to identify which ones are actual stories and which ones are not. And it's not as easy as you might think. Until you can tell the difference between a real leadership story and something posing as one, you'll never be able to craft one yourself. So, try the quizzes out, and see how you do. But before then, let me give you an example of one of my favorite leadership stories so you can see what I'm talking about. In 1971, Bob McDonald was a first year cadet at the US Military Academy in West Point. And he learned pretty quickly that there were only four acceptable answers to any question asked by a superior officer. Yes sir, no sir, I don't understand sir, and no excuse sir. Now, the example he gives is, imagine I've shined my shoes, and my trousers are pressed, and I go out to formation. Now, while I'm standing there in line, one of my classmates runs past and steps in a puddle and splashes mud all over my shoes and trousers. And then an upperclassman walks by and notices, and says, McDonald, why are you in formation with mud all over your shoes and trousers? Now, I've got to go through all four possible answers in my head. Now, I could say yes sir, but that would just restate the obvious. I could say no sir, but that's not even true, and I'd get thrown out of the academy for lying. Now, I could say I don't understand sir, but that would just make me look stupid, and I was doing a good enough job of that already. So, the only answer I had left was the fourth one. And it's the most powerful one of all. No excuse sir. Now, even when something happened to me that was outside of my control, I wasn't supposed to make any excuses. I was supposed to say, no excuse sir. It won't happen again. That's how a West Point cadet takes responsibility, which is an important part of character. Well, Bob was reminded that lesson 13 years later when he and his wife were discussing what to do about their six-year-old daughter, Jenny. Now, they just couldn't see to get her to clean her room. And so at one point, they marched into Jenny's room to give her a good reprimand. And now, Bob said, Jenny, we'd like to talk to you about the condition of your room. But before he could even get to his second sentence, Jenny looked up at him, and with all the seriousness of a West Point cadet said, \"No excuse, Dad. \"It won't happen again.\" She'd obviously been listening to him tell his West Point stories. Now, Bob and his wife just stood there in awkward silence. Dumbfounded, really. Trying to figure out what to say next. With those seven simple words, Jenny had acknowledged the state of her room, taken responsibility for it, and promised not to let it happen again. There was really nothing left to say, so they kissed their little girl on the cheek, and left her to clean her room. Now, for decades after that, Bob shared that story with his leaders to teach them the same lesson, including in his tenure as the CEO and chairman of the largest consumer products company in the world, Procter and Gamble. Now, in that role, one of his primary responsibilities was to set stretching goals and objectives for the company, and to get all 127,000 employees committed to delivering them You know, truly committing to a goal means that if it isn't met, you take responsibility for it, and promise to get it done. The no excuse sir response is a clear indication of commitment and responsibility. And it works just as well in the business world as it does in the military academy, or in parenting a six-year-old. And it works for the boss just as much as it does for the subordinate. When the boss hears, no excuse, however it's articulated, she can be certain that her subordinate is taking responsibility, and is still committed to the goal. For the direct report, the disarming no excuse response spares him a lengthy reprimand from the boss. Just like it spared Jenny. So, when I say a leadership story, I really do mean a story about something that happened to someone that other people can learn from. It's not just a clever speech or a great presentation. Why storytelling works There's nothing wrong with the way most leaders talk to their employees, or write their memos, or give their speeches, or even make their presentations. But all those things could be much more effective if they included a few good stories. Here are five of the most compelling reasons why. Number one, storytelling speaks to the part of the brain where decisions are actually made. You know, apparently, human beings don't always make the logical, rational decisions that we like to think we do. More often than not, we make subconscious, emotional, and sometimes even irrational decisions in one place in our brain, and then we justify those decisions logically and rationally a few nanoseconds later in a conscious thinking part of the brain. So, if you're trying to influence what people think and feel and do, in other words, leadership, using facts and rational arguments alone aren't enough. You need to influence the subconscious, emotional processing part of the brain as well. Stories are your best vehicle to do that. Okay, number two. Stories are viral by nature. You tell a good story, and it will spread all over your world, however big your world is. People love to share good stories, so they do, just by word-of-mouth. But I'll bet that doesn't happen to your policy memos and corporate emails. Number three, stories make things easier to remember. A number of studies have shown that facts are between six and 22 times more likely to be remembered if they're embedded in a story than if they're just given to people in a list. But you don't have to believe any of the studies, because I'm going to prove it to you right now. That is that all of you watching this right now know that by this time tomorrow, none of you are going to remember this list of five things. That's okay, I'm not going to be offended. But all of you watching this right now also know that by this time tomorrow, you will remember the details of the last interesting story that you heard. Next week, next month, and next year, most of you will be able to tell that story and get most of the facts right, but none of you will remember this list of five things. That's the power of a good story. All right, number four. Stories appeal to all types of learners. You probably learned in high school that there are three basic types of learners. Auditory, people who learn best from what they hear, visual, people who learn best from what they see, and kinesthetic. That's people who learn best from what they do or feel. Well, it turns out storytelling works with all three. You know, auditory learners obviously benefit from hearing a good story, but what about visual learners? Well, what do you think they're doing while you're telling your story? They're watching it play out in their mind's eye like a movie, right? But if you tell them something that's not in the form of a story, there's no movie to watch in their head, so they won't learn it as well. And the kinesthetic learners, those people remember and connect with the emotions and the feelings in the story. So, unlike just about every other form of communication, storytelling works for all three types of learners. Lastly, number five. Stories inspire. Slides don't. I mean, when's the last time you heard someone say, \"Wow, you'll never believe \"the PowerPoint presentation I just saw!\" Never, right? But you do hear people say that about great stories. When to tell leadership stories Storytelling is a leadership tool, not a management tool. So when you're trying to make a decision or run more efficient process, storytelling isn't necessarily the best tool to turn to. But if what you're trying to do is lead people, storytelling is an absolutely indispensable skill to have. Now that's the conclusion I came to after interviewing hundreds of CEOs and leaders about their use of storytelling. You know, I asked them what situations they found themselves in when they decided to tell a story, what story they told and if it worked. And now, each leader probably told me somewhere between eight and 12 different stories, so do the math and I've literally documented around 3,000 individual leadership stories. Now that's allowed me to reverse engineer my way into what works and what doesn't, but what it also did was give me some insight into the diversity of leadership challenges where storytelling can help and all the stories seem to fit nicely into 21 different categories and I've organized them into five different groups based on the overall goal. Now the first group I called envision. You know, those are stories to help you set a vision for the future, to build accountability and commitment to goals, to lead change, to make your recommendations stick or to define customer service excellence. Now the next group is about the environment that a leader creates. Now those are stories to help define the culture and the values of an organization to encourage collaboration, to value diversity and inclusion or even to set policy without creating a bunch of new rules. Now the third group I called energize. So those are stories to help inspire and motivate the team, to build courage for a tough task or even to help people just find the passion for their work again. Now the next one is educate. Those are stories that you tell to teach an important lesson or provide coaching and feedback, to demonstrate how to solve tough problems and how to get people to understand the customer. Now the last group is empower. Now those are stories that you tell to delegate authority and give permission or to encourage creativity and innovation or to create master salespeople and even to earn respect in the organization. Now I'll admit it might be hard to see exactly how you could create a story for all 21 of those situations without hearing a few examples. So fortunately, we've got several other LinkedIn courses that can help you with that. The first is called Leadership Stories Weekly and it's a collection of 52 leadership stories where I'll give you concrete examples of how stories can be used for all kinds of leadership purposes. Alright, next. If you work in sales and marketing, I've got another LinkedIn course that illustrates 25 different types of stories that are helpful across the entire sales process from meeting a prospect to closing a sale. Now it's called Selling with Stories, Part Two Stories Great Sales People Tell. Now that's an awful lot of stories because there probably is an infinite number of uses for storytelling in the workplace, but in my course called Stories Great Leaders Tell, I give you specific examples of what I think are the 10 most important stories that every leader should be able to tell at any time and here's the list. The first four go together and they're about setting direction for the organization. Where we came from, our founding story. Why we can't stay here, the case for change story. Where we're going, a vision story and how we're going to get there, a strategy story. Now the next four are about who we are as an organization. What we believe, a corporate value story. Who we serve, a customer story. What we do for our customers, a sales story and how we're different from our competitors, a marketing story and the last two are a little more personal. Why I lead the way I do, a leadership philosophy story and why you should want to work here, a recruiting story. So if you want to listen to concrete examples of any of those types of leadership stories, check out the courses I mentioned. What makes a great story a great story What is it that makes a great story a great story? Now I'd argue that for any kind of story, whether that's a business story or the kind of story you'd read in a book or see in a movie, there are three things that make it great. A hero we care about. A villain we're afraid of. And an epic battle between them. Now I'll admit that sounds a bit Hollywood so let's translate that into something more realistic. That hero we care about just becomes a relatable main character, someone your audience can relate to. The villain we're afraid of just becomes a relevant challenge, the kind of problem your audience might find themselves facing. And the epic battle between them just becomes an honest struggle. The audience needs to see the main character struggle a bit to solve the problem. And since this is a leadership story and not just a story to entertain people, we have to add a fourth element to the list and that's this, that the audience learns a worthy lesson. In fact, that's the first element you should consider in choosing a story, the lesson it teaches. Now that may sound obvious and it should be but I can't tell you how many emails I get from people who ask, \"Hey, I've got a big presentation next week. \"You got any good stories I could use?\" As if I could possibly recommend a good story without having the slightest clue what their presentation is about or what their objectives are. It just doesn't work that way. So choose a story based on the message you're trying to convey. Okay, next let's talk about the relatable main character. The most compelling character for one of your stories is someone your audience can identify with. That means they can either imagine themselves in the same position or working with that person. Now I know a lot of leaders who like to tell stories about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Jack Welch and those are fine, but most people can't see themselves as a high-tech visionary or a titan of industry. Plus, the fact that Bill Gates did something amazing might be entertaining, but it won't help most people do their jobs better because they're not Bill Gates. But you tell them a story about someone who had their job five years ago and was facing the same challenge that they're facing now, they'll be all ears. Okay, next the relevant challenge. The challenge is a problem or an opportunity the main character runs into. Now when it's a problem, the challenge plays the role of the villain in the story but that doesn't mean the villain has to be a person. The obstacle could be one of your competitors or the mountain you're trying to climb or even the photocopy machine you finally get your revenge on. And when it's an opportunity, it becomes the motivating force driving the main character like a challenging goal say to grow sales by 50% or an opportunity like getting a new job or a promotion. Regardless of what the challenge is though, it should be relevant to the audience. All right, last, let's talk about the honest struggle. The struggle between the hero and the villain is the heart and the soul of storytelling. If there's no struggle, there's no story. That means it can't be too easy for the hero to get what they're after. Here's an example. Bob desperately needed a 3/4 inch socket wrench to finish his project. There was simply no way to complete the job on time without one. So he reached in his toolbox and he grabbed one. The end. Do you see how wrong that is? I mean it's so wrong it's actually shocking probably because it violates our core understanding of what a story should sound like. The story has a main character, Bob, and an obstacle, the lack of a socket wrench, but there's just no struggle. It's too easy. We can't care about Bob or his project until we see him struggle. Your audience has to see your main character struggle. So if your stories have these four elements, you almost certainly have a decent story. Choose the right story to tell The most important part of storytelling is choosing the right story to tell. If you tell the wrong story it doesn't matter how well you tell it you won't accomplish your objective. So how do you come up with the right story to tell? Three simple steps. Step one, define your objective. Always start with the end in mind and since the most important element of a great story is that the story has a worthy lesson you have to start by determining what lesson you want your audience to learn. Now specifically what do you want your audience to think, feel, or do as a result of hearing your story. Now once you can articulate that clearly in your mind you're ready to move on to step two. Think of a relevant success, failure, or moment of clarity around your objective. That thing that you want your audience to think, feel, or do. In other words, think of times in the past when you or someone else has done that thing really, really well a success or really, really badly a failure because we learn as much from our failures as we do our successes. Or when you learned that lesson the first time yourself, a moment of clarity. Now if that situation taught you the lesson so well it'll teach others when they hear about it through a story. Okay, if nothing comes to mind from your past then move on to step three, go on a story hunt. Every story you tell shouldn't be about you anyway. If they were you'd come across as a bit of a self absorbed leader. Now you should have stories about other people in your repertoire so find them, ask your boss, your subordinates, your peers, anyone really for help finding the stories that you're looking for. Create a wish list of stories that you need and share the list. You'd be surprised how willing people are to tell you their stories when they know what you're looking for. Story structures All good stories have a structure. Without it, you might skip an important part of the story or just as bad, put a bunch of stuff in that you don't need. I've seen too many fabulous four-minute leadership stories wind up as boring, ineffective, 10-minute nightmares because they didn't follow a good structure. I'm going to lay out the structure I recommend, and if you follow that structure, it'll make sure you answer the eight questions every story should answer. Let's walk through those sections first, and then the eight questions, okay? All right, first, the hook is what gets your audience to pay attention. The context is the setting of the story, where and when it took place. The challenge is the problem or opportunity the main character ran into. Now, that's where the hero meets the villain the first time. The conflict is the action of the story. That's where the hero actually does battle with the villain. The resolution is how everything turned out in the end. And the lesson and recommended action are where you draw conclusions and move your listener to some kind of an action. Those are the main parts. Structuring your story that way allows you to answer the eight questions your story needs to answer, and in the order you need to answer them. Here are those eight questions. The first question you have to answer is why should I listen to the story? Because if you don't answer that question in the first 10 to 15 seconds, your audience might not listen to your story. They might mentally, physically, or emotionally walk away from your story. Once you've given your listener a good reason to listen, then you've earned the right to answer the next five questions. Where and when did it take place? Who's the main character and what do they want? What was the problem or opportunity they ran into? What did they do about it? And how did it turn out in the end? And that should sound like the flow of a typical story, but you're not done yet. After you tell the story, you'll want to make sure your audience understands what they were supposed to learn and what action they should take. That's why the last two questions are what did you learn form it? And what do you think I should do now? And the order you answer those questions matters, because unlike in a business memo, the resolution and recommendation, they go at the end, not at the beginning. Just imagine if you found out at the beginning of a murder mystery who the murderer was. It'd ruin the entire story. Or imagine you're telling someone a fantastic story but you didn't answer the question about where and when it happened. Now, depending on how fantastic the story is, they might actually start wondering if it was true. In fact, sometimes it bothers them so much, they stop you and ask. They say, \"C'mon Paul, is this true? \"Did this really happen? \"When was this? \"Where was this?\" They'll actually ask you question number two because until they get those questions answered, it's just too hard for them to move on to the rest of the story. That's how stories should flow. They should answer the eight questions in the proper order. And doing that helps make sure that you don't leave out anything important and that the story makes sense, while also making sure you're not including too much information that can make your stories too long and too boring. Do not ask permission, Do not tell them a story is coming Do not give away the ending The hook Some of the most common mistakes I see in storytelling happen right at the beginning, because people just have no idea how to get started telling their story. So before I tell you how to do it, I want to tell you how not to do it. So first, never apologize or ask permission for telling a leadership story. And you've seen this happen before. You'll be in the middle of a meeting and someone says oh I'm sorry to interrupt, but can I just tell a quick story? I promise, it'll just take a minute. Now what do you think that communicates about how important the story is? Well not very important, right? And if it's not that important, then please, don't tell it. Just get back to the bullet points on slide number 72. But if you do think your story's important, then just tell it. Leaders don't ask permission to lead, they just lead. Never apologize or ask permission to tell a leadership story. Okay second. Don't even tell your audience you're going to tell them a story. You know, imagine I'm your boss and I'm standing here in front of you to kick of a meeting and I say well okay everyone, I just wanted to get things going around here, so I thought I'd start by telling you a story. Now, what's your reaction to that so far? Well, if you're honest, most of you are rolling your eyes right now thinking ugh, do we really have time for this? Can't you just give us the facts? Now imagine instead, if I kicked off the meeting by saying something like this: well okay everyone, let's go ahead and get started. And as you may have heard, something really important happened last week, and it's completely changed how I think about running this department. I thought I'd tell you about that. Well now what's your reaction? And it's probably the polar opposite. Well, let's hear it! Now, in both cases, the boss is going to tell you exactly the same story, but announcing you're going to tell a story just makes some people feel like they're in kindergarten again, or that you're going to waste their time. Grown ups don't need to be told you're going to tell them a story, just tell it. Alright, lastly, don't kick off the story by giving away the ending or even the specific lesson. If you do, they won't have any reason to listen to your story. Now, you can tell them you're going to share the best lesson you've ever learned about running a small business, but if you tell them upfront that that lesson is to not hire family because then it's too hard to fire them when they don't work hard, they're not going to be as interested in listening to your story, because they already know how it ends, and you've already told them the lesson. Okay, so if we're not going to kick it off with an apology, asking permission, the lesson, or the word story, how do we kick off our stories? And the answer is with a simple phrase or a sentence that tells them why you're sharing the story. For example, if someone asks you a question and you want to answer it with a story, your hook could be, you know I think the best example of that I've ever seen was when, and now you're telling a story. Or if you want to give someone advice about a problem you might say gosh, that's a tough problem. Let me tell you what I did last year when I ran into that same problem, and then you're telling your story. Or if you want to share a story as an example of something you might say, so for instance, there was this one time when, and then tell your story. That's it, it's that simple. The context The context is the setting of your story. It answers the questions where and when does the story take place, who's the main character, and what do they want? Now, explaining where and when a story takes place provides instant credibility. It lets the audience know that it's a true story and not just something you made up. The second question is about the main character. Your story will be more effective the more relatable your main character is to your audience. They should be able to see themselves in that person. Stories about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs are nice every once in a while, but most of your stories should be about regular people, just like your audience. And while we're on the subject of your main character, for a lot of people, the closest they've ever come to crafting a real story at work is writing a case study. In case studies, the main character is usually a company. Now, the company did this, and the company did that. But an impersonal corporate entity isn't nearly as relatable to a human being as another human being. So, whenever possible, your main characters should be people, not companies. Don't say, \"The company decided to cut its marketing budget.\" Say, \"Sarah, the chief financial officer, \"decided to cut the marketing budget.\" All right, the last question that context answers is, what does the main character want? In other words, what is your main character trying to achieve in the story? Are they trying to save the world or just beat their competition? Are they trying to make their profit objective or just not get fired? Whatever it is, your main character's objective should be one your audience would deem worthy. Otherwise, they lose interest in your story. Once you've shared where and when the story takes place, who the main character is, and what they wanted, then you're ready to move on to the challenge they faced. Main character should be people, not company Objective - Challenge, conflict, and resolution Once your audience knows the setting of the story and who your main character is, it's time to get that character into an interesting situation and see what happens to them. Let's talk about the next three parts of a story: the challenge, the conflict, and the resolution. First, let's look at the challenge, which answers the question, what was the problem or opportunity the main character ran into? Now, this is sometimes called the complication or the catalyst because it's the moment that a monkey wrench gets thrown into the hero's original plans and sets off the entire series of events in the story. It's usually pretty short, just a few sentences, but just because it's short doesn't mean it's not important. If you left out the challenge, nothing interesting could happen in the rest of the story. You need the monkey wrench or the story won't make any sense. Now, let's talk about the conflict. This is the heart and the soul of storytelling. The conflict is where you answer the question, what did the main character do about the challenge? Now, this is where the main character actually does battle with a villain, and it's important for your audience to see your main character struggle. If you find yourself introducing your hero and the challenge, and then saying something like, \"And, long story short, we won the contract,\" you've just ruined the story because you skipped the struggle. Now there's no conflict. Don't skip the conflict. Let the audience see your main character struggle. Now, this is the single, most important part of a story, and the part where most of the plot will play out, so invest the time to get this right. In fact, it's not unusual for 50 to 60% of the words in your story to be in the conflict. Okay, last, the resolution. The resolution is where you answer the question, how did everything turn out in the end? Did the hero win or lose? Did the plan work? And this is where you wrap up any remaining loose ends. Now, a common question at this point is how do I know when I've wrapped up enough of the loose ends? And the answer is when your audience knows how to feel about what happened. Not when they know what to think about what happened. You'll cover that in the conversations about the next two questions after you're done telling the story. For now, you can stop telling the story when your audience knows how to emotionally process what happened in the story. Challenge, Conflict, (Important one, never skip this - most of the plot - 50 to 60 words) Resolution, Listen - Lesson and action So you just told a great story. Now what? Well, the most productive thing you can do after you finish telling the story is to just listen. Remember, presumably you're having a conversation with someone. It's a requirement that you let them talk at some point. This is that point and the reason is that people are far more passionate about pursuing their ideas than they are about pursuing your ideas. Give the story a chance to work. You know, if you picked a good story to tell and did a halfway decent job of telling it, your audience will already have come to the conclusion that you wanted them to and will already be thinking about taking the action you wanted them to take. Find out and if they did, you never have to answer questions like, what should I learn from this and what do you think I should do now? Your audience will have answered them for you. Now if you find out they came to the wrong conclusion or recommended action, you can always answer the questions yourself and redirect them. Yeah, I thought about that too, but I came to a different conclusion and here's why. But if you told a great story, you won't even have to do that. Create an emotional connection Emotions play a critical role in decision-making. It turns out, human beings make subconscious emotional decisions in one place in the brain and then justify those decisions more logically and rationally a few nanoseconds later in another place in the brain. So while it may sound counterintuitive, we need emotions to make decisions, and while facts and figures and logical arguments aren't very good at reaching people emotionally, stories are great at it. In fact, one of my favorite definitions of the word story is by the novelist E. M. Forster. He said that a story was nothing more than a fact plus an emotion, and he gave a brilliantly simple example. He said, \"If I were to tell you that the king died \"and then the queen died, \"well, that wouldn't be a story, would it? \"But if I told you the king died \"and then the queen died of grief, now that's a story.\" And why is it a story? Because with those two little words of grief, you can immediately imagine what must've happened. Oh my gosh, the queen, she must've so loved the king that when he died she stopped eating and so she withered away, or maybe she was so distraught that she took her own life, like all those stories come to mind just because of the last two words, of grief. The emotion turns the fact into a story. Now, fortunately, the folks in Hollywood figured out a long time ago how to create more of an emotional connection in stories, and you can use some of the same techniques. Here three of them. The first is just called tell me. Just name the emotion your characters are experiencing, so that your listener can be aware of it. Just saying, I was shocked or he was scared out of his wits or she was so excited is the simplest method to help your audience understand the emotion that's going on, and that's a good start, but a better technique is number two, which is called show me. Now, that doesn't mean you should start acting shocked or happy or sad, this is a leadership course, not an acting course. It means, show your audience how your characters feel by describing the physical manifestations of the emotion on the character. So instead of saying she was angry, say she started yelling or her face got beet red, or instead of saying, he was sad, say he started crying. Describe what your character did, and let the audience figure out the emotion. Now, the third technique is dialogue. People say what they think and feel, so instead of you telling the audience what the characters feel, let them hear that directly, even if it's words your characters are thinking without saying out loud. For example, instead of telling the audience that the hero was feeling anxious during her big speech, you could share her inner thoughts this way. She leaned into the microphone and said, I'm very excited to be speaking to you here today, but inside, she was thinking, oh my God, I'm so nervous, I might actually throw up. Find the moments in your story that have the highest potential for emotion and use one or more of these techniques. Your stories will be much more engaging, memorable, and effective. Emotions - Excited, Shocked Tell me, Show me, Dialogue Anxious, Surprise It's no probably no surprise to you that a surprise is an important element of a great story. We all love the surprise ending in a mystery novel or the unexpected turn of events in our favorite movie. But there's actually a more important reason to include something unexpected in your leadership stories, it actually makes them more effective. A surprise at the beginning of a story gets your audience to pay attention. It shakes people out of thinking about the last email they read or the next meeting they have to go to and gets them to focus squarely on the story that you're telling them. But more than just capturing the audience's attention surprises help your audience remember the lesson at the end of the story. Now here's how that works. It turns out memories don't form instantly in a brain like pictures from a digital camera. It turns out they form over a period of time after the event happens more like pictures from an old-fashioned film camera when they're developed in a dark room. Now psychologists call that period the memory consolidation period. And it can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to a few hours. And it turns out certain chemicals like caffeine can enhance the memory consolidation process. They literally make it faster and more effective. Now another chemical that has a similar effect is adrenaline the kind of adrenaline that gets released in your system when you get frightened or surprised. So that surprise at the end of your story literally makes the ending of the story where the lesson is more memorable. So if your story doesn't have anything surprising in it, can you just skip that step and move on? Well, I suppose if you're happy with a mediocre story. But if you want a great story you should have a surprise somewhere in it. Now one technique is to create a surprise at the beginning of the story by simply starting with the most unexpected thing that happens in the story and then use the flashback technique like they do in the movies. Start with the surprise and then flashback to the beginning of the story and work your way back to the surprise. Now you can also create a surprise at the end by taking something that's important from the beginning of the story and not giving it to your audience until the end. All right here's a simple example. One day a nine-year-old boy named James was in the kitchen with his mom's sister who was having a cup of tea. Now while auntie was enjoying her tea, James was standing at the stove watching the tea kettle boil. And he was just fascinated with it. He's watching the steam come out of the top of the kettle and he had a spoon and he held it up there and watched the little drops of water that formed on the spoon and then ran down the handle and dripped into a cup and he just watched this cycle go over and over and over again just fascinated with it. Well eventually his aunt just barked at him something along the lines of, James go read a book, do your homework, go outside and ride your bike. Aren't you ashamed of yourself just wasting your time like this? Well fortunately young James was undaunted by her admonition because two decades later at the age of 29 and in the year 1765, James Watt reinvented the steam engine. Ushering in the Industrial Revolution that we of course all benefit from today and all based on a fascination with steam that he developed at the age of nine in the kitchen. Now when I first read that story it was in a book titled, James Watt, written by Andrew Carnegie in 1905. So to me it was no surprise of course that the story had in chapter one about nine-year-old James was about James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine. The entire book was a biography of James Watt but to you it was probably a surprise. And why? Because I didn't tell you his last name. I simply moved something important from the beginning of the story, his last name to the end of the story. Presto, surprise ending. It's that simple and you can do it with almost any story. Unexpected Surprise - Memory consolidation period Start with Surprise - Flash back technique End with Surprise Next steps Congratulations, you've reach the end of this course on storytelling for leaders, but if you really want to master the craft of leadership storytelling, and turn it into a habit, you'll have to keep working at it. So, here are a few tips and tools to help get you started. First, start your own story wishlist. It'll help you figure out which stories you need the most. Okay, second, start hunting for and crafting stories on your list. You know, start with the most important, and always be on the lookout for the next story you need. Search your own past, but also ask your co workers. Show them your wishlist. You'll be surprised how many people will be willing to share their stories. Okay third. Use the Storytelling for Leaders Cheat Sheet in the exercise file, It highlights everything we covered in this course. Fourth, see examples of great leadership stories in other LinkedIn courses. Stories every leader tells, and leadership stories weekly. Fifth, create your own leadership story database to keep all your stories where you can find them. There's a blank story database you can use as a starting point in the exercise files for this course. Okay sixth, want more help crafting leadership stories? Everything we didn't have time to cover here is in my book Lead With a Story. Or, connect with me on LinkedIn, and I'll be happy to answer your questions. Finally, start telling your leadership stories. Each time you share one, take note of your audience's reaction. What worked and what didn't? What did you accidentally add or omit? Go back to the story database and make whatever changes you think necessary. Now you have everything you need to craft compelling leadership stories.","title":"Storiestotell"},{"location":"resources/books/","text":"An Introduction to Statistical Learning Deep Learning Book - MIT Press Better and Faster: The Proven Path to Unstoppable Ideas","title":"Books"},{"location":"resources/courses/","text":"30 days of ML - Kaggle 30 days of ML - Kaggle - Assignments Machine Learning Crash Course - By Google Introduction to Machine Learning - IIT Madras, NPTEL (CS-188 by Berkely) Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - IIT Madras, NPTEL Knowledge Representation and Reasoning - IIT Madras, NPTEL Python Courses Mongo DB University","title":"Courses"},{"location":"resources/git/","text":"First time or whenver you are setting up a new machine: * connecting your laptop to Github account through SSH * ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"emailid of the github\" * incase you are keeping your email addresses private, you need to copy the email from \"Keep my email addresses private\" section under Github Settings - Emails * eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\" * update config - ~/.ssh/config * ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 * pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -- Copy public ssh key to Clipboard * ssh -T git@github.com Ongoing: * Whenever you want to clone a repository * git clone https://github.com/repourl.git * Verify the git remote repo * git remote -v * git status","title":"Git"},{"location":"resources/git/#first-time-or-whenver-you-are-setting-up-a-new-machine","text":"* connecting your laptop to Github account through SSH * ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"emailid of the github\" * incase you are keeping your email addresses private, you need to copy the email from \"Keep my email addresses private\" section under Github Settings - Emails * eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\" * update config - ~/.ssh/config * ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 * pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -- Copy public ssh key to Clipboard * ssh -T git@github.com","title":"First time or whenver you are setting up a new machine:"},{"location":"resources/git/#ongoing","text":"* Whenever you want to clone a repository * git clone https://github.com/repourl.git * Verify the git remote repo * git remote -v * git status","title":"Ongoing:"},{"location":"resources/lead/","text":"Is Conflict is good?
