                <p>Great leaders are great storytellers</p>
<ul>
<li>Every great leader is a great storyteller. And the first and most important part of being a great storyteller is knowing what stories to tell. Hi, I'm Paul Smith, author of the book The 10 Stories Great Leaders Tell. There are a lot of resources out there to help you craft better stories at work, and I spent most of my professional time doing exactly that. But that's not the first question most leaders ask. The first question is usually what stories do I need to tell? And that's the right first question because if you're not telling the right stories, it doesn't matter how well you tell them. So after working with thousands of leaders and conducting literally hundreds of one-on-one interviews with CEOs and executives in 25 countries around the world, I've put together a list of the most important 10 stories I think every leader needs to be able to tell at a moment's notice. And when I say a story, I don't just mean a well-articulate opinion about these topics. You should have that to, of course. What I mean is that for each one, you should have a unique narrative about something interesting that actually happened to someone that will help everyone in your organization understand your concept on a personal, visceral level. So in this course, I'll be sharing an example of each story along with some tips on how you can come up with similar stories of your own. Let's get started. </li>
</ul>
<p>The 10 stories every leader should tell</p>
<ul>
<li>In my work on storytelling business I've documented over 3000 individual stories and I think the number of different types of stories a good leader could tell is nearly limitless. But to help leaders focus on the most important ones I decided to pick the top ten and here's the criteria I used first, I included the kinds of stories leaders most often ask me for help with. Second, I chose stories in areas where every leader should be exerting some influence in the organization. Third, I looked for stories that would be useful to leaders in just about any functional discipline from general management to marketing, sales, finance, HR, IT, engineering, whatever. And last, I looked for stories that won't need to change very often. So you can get a lot of mileage out of each one. Okay here's the list of ten stories. And the first four go together because they're about setting direction for the company, so here are those four. Where we came from, a founding story. Why we can't stay there, a case for change story. Where we're going, a vision story. And how we're going to get there, a strategy story. Now the next four go together as well but they're more about who we are as an organization. What we believe, a corporate values story. Who we serve, a customer story. What we do for our customers, a sales story. And how we're different from our competitors, a marketing story. Okay the last two are a little bit more personal. Why I lead the way I do, a personal leadership philosophy story. And why you should want to work here, a recruiting story. So there they are, the ten stories every leader should be able to tell. Let's dive in. </li>
</ul>
<p>Where we came from (our founding story)</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody ever quit their job, risked everything and started their own company for a boring reason, and that's why you should be telling your company's founding story. It's probably exciting, and sharing a great founding story gives employees a chance to be part of something bigger than their job. It shows them the passion and drive behind why the founder started the company in the first place, so that they can have the same sense of passion. Now, here's an example. In the late 1980s, Gary Erickson was living in a San Francisco Bay Area trying to hold down two jobs. Now, during the day, he was managing a bicycle seat manufacturing company, but at night, he was pursuing his real passion, running his own bakery. Well, one day in 1990, he was out for 175 mile day-long bike ride with a friend, and as most bikers do, he'd brought up half dozen energy bars with him for refueling along the route. Well, anyway, they got to the top of Mount Hamilton, just east of San Jose, and they took a break. Now, Gary had already eaten five of his six bars, but he was still famished, and he had 50 miles left to go. Well, he looked at the sixth one in his hand, and he thought, no way. I can't do one more. I'd rather starve than eat another one of these. Now, if you're familiar with some of those early energy bars, you understand why. They were hard and sticky and just kind of sat in your stomach like a rock. Well, as he was coasting back down into San Jose on an empty stomach, Gary was thinking to himself, wait a minute, I've got a bakery and everything we make tastes great, </li>
</ul>
<p>Why we can't stay there (a case-for-change story)</p>
<ul>
<li>Human beings are creatures of habit, and that means change is hard. And without a compelling human reason, people won't adapt quickly or effectively to whatever change you've got planned. A case for change story gives them that reason why. And the best story to answer that question will be one about whoever stands to benefit most from the change. So here's an example. In February 2015, NPR aired a story about Joey, a 10-year-old boy in Gainseville, Florida, who suffered from a rare form of kidney cancer. Now when Joey was diagnosed in March 2013, the cancer had already spread to his stomach and his chest and his neck, and he went through two surgeries and five rounds of chemotherapy. None of which worked for more than a month or two. Well, eventually, he'd exhausted all the treatments available. Well, by the fall of 2014, with no remaining treatment options, the doctors told his mother, Kathy, to just take Joey home and enjoy their remaining time together. So Kathy was desperate. She said we can't just go home. For us, that means giving up. Well, then in September, the FDA approved a new drug called Keytruda, made by Merck. So Kathy called doctors across the country to find one willing to use it on a 10-year-old boy. And she found one in Cincinnati. So Kathy, her husband, their three-year-old, and Joey all packed their things in Florida and moved to Cincinnati. Now Joey got that first injection of Keytruda on October 14, over a year and a half after being diagnosed. Now the good news was that the tumors in his neck started to shrink immediately, and the ones in the rest of his body at least stabilized, but Joey was already weak when the treatment started, and the cancer had an 18-month head start. Well, six weeks later, the day before Thanksgiving, Joey passed away. Now Kathy told the reporters, if Joey could've just gotten this drug last year, even just a couple of months earlier, maybe it would've been a different story. Now when that story aired on NPR, one of the people who heard it worked at a company that had just retained me as their storytelling coach. And the industry they worked in also produced life-saving products, but that also took a notoriously long time to get to market, sometimes a decade or more. So like most of their competitors, one of the things they were working on was how to get products to market faster. But changing a complex, decade-long process is hard work. And trying to motivate the employees by telling them how much more money the company would make just wasn't working. My job was to help them develop a case for change story. And when the person in my workshop shared NPR's story of Kathy and Joey, it immediately became the basis for their story, their case for change. Now think about that. Keytruda wasn't their product, and Joey wasn't their customer, but it did become their story, or at least a fictionalized version of it because they knew the same thing was surely happening with the life-saving products that they were working on. And having a human reason to do all this hard work was a more effective motivator than higher profits and a growing stock price. So to come up with your own case for change story, start by asking yourself who stands to benefit from this change. Surely, it's good for someone or it wouldn't be a priority for the company, right? Now once you know who that is, talk to them and ask these kinds of questions, what's your life or work like today prior to making this change? What problems or frustrations do you have? Or how would your life or work be different once you implement the change? And then what are the tangible ways you know the change is working? Now sure, not everyone will have a story as compelling as Kathy and Joey because not everyone's job is curing cancer. But whatever it is that you and your company are trying to do with this change will surely benefit someone. Find them, and that will be your case for change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Where we're going (a vision story)</p>
<ul>
<li>A vision is a picture of the future so compelling, people want to go there with you. In other words, a story about the future. Now unfortunately, what passes for a vision today is often just a vision sentence or a phrase like 20% market share by 2020. Seriously? That's a goal, not a vision. And here's a better way that I stumbled across myself. In 2002, I was asked to lead a group of forecasters who's job it was to predict the future sales of new products. But, since you can't predict the future perfectly, they knew their predictions were always going to be wrong. They just didn't know if it'd be too high or too low and by how much. Well, to make matters worse, they were often under trained, had forecasting models that were overly complicated or poorly documented and based on old data. Now my job was to lead them through whatever changes were needed to fix all that. But the solution wasn't something that I could just do for them; it would take a lot of work on their part. My challenge was to lay out a vision and hopefully inspire enough of them to do the hard work necessary to get there. So I wrote them a vision story and it stared out like this: below is a picture of the future. It's my vision of what a day in the life of a sales forecaster could be in the near future. Now, some of you may feel you're already pretty close to this and some may feel infinitely far away. Either way, I want to make this a vision that we all share, either by adding your ideas to it or embracing it as is, let me know what you think. And in the subject line of the email, I wrote, the vision: a day in the life of a sales forecaster. And the story it contained introduced Sheri, a sales forecaster two years in the future. And then the story simply followed Sheri through a single day at work. What she did, and the meetings she attended, and for the people reading it, it was clear how different her experience was from what they experienced day to day. You know, the story followed Sheri to meetings that she previously wouldn't have even been invited to because her opinion wasn't valued as much before. And then, instead of feeling uncertain when she answered questions in a meeting, she felt confident, because she'd been more properly trained and her models were updated with the most recent data. And instead of fumbling around in her forecast model, trying to figure out how it worked and troubleshooting issues, she simply opened the new instruction manual and followed the instructions. And as the story continued, it became clear that she experienced none of the typical frustrations a forecaster would be familiar with. And then the story closed at the end of the day when Sheri was walking out of a meeting. You know, two people thanked her for her great ideas and said that they really liked this new leadership role the forecasters seemed to be playing in the business. And the final words of the story read, she hadn't realized it before now, but she actually liked her job. It was a lot more fun to come to work when you know what you're doing and that you're having a positive impact on the results. Now, the first response I got to the email was, oh wow, I want that to be my story two years from now. I'm in. Well after a dozen or so responses like that, I knew I'd stumbled upon something right with the story. So to craft a vision story of your own, start by deciding who will benefit most if you vision is achieved. Then choose a fictional character from that group to be the main character of your story and then just sketch out what a typical day at work will be like for them after your vision has been achieved. You know, make sure to include the type of activities that are both important to your audience and heavily impacted by having achieved the vision. You know, if your goal is winning in the marketplace, what's better about that? Will employees be prouder to work there? If so, then maybe show your main character reading a flattering article about your company in Fortune magazine. You know, if you goal is to grow sales and profits faster, what's better about that? Will that mean bigger bonuses? Will it open up new job opportunities for your employees or create more challenging work? Show that in the story. And then, conclude with a summary of how your main character feels about the world he or she is living in and working in now compared to the way things were before and that's your vision story. </li>
</ul>
<p>How we're going to get there (a strategy story)</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy is how you get from where you are now to where you want to be. In other words, a strategy is a journey. And what better way to describe a journey than a story? Here's a creative example I came across. The cough cold industry is a seasonal business. You know, the overwhelming majority of cold medicines and cough syrups and and facial tissues are sold either in the winter cold season or the spring allergy season. And like a lot of businesses, there's usually one dominant brand and then a distant second, and third place brand. Well, one year all the employees, at one of those second place brands got to work one morning, to find something unexpected on their desks. A copy of what looked like an article from the Wall Street Journal, except it wasn't really a journal article. It was just a memo designed to look like one. And strangely, the date at the top was six years in the future. And the title was how David beat Goliath. And here's the gist of what it said. It introduced a guy named Vavec whose 12 year old daughter, had just signed up to play basketball on a team with a bunch of girls, who'd never played the game and who had no coach. Now he knew they didn't have much of a chance of winning a game even with a coach and none without. So he volunteered. Now, they ended up in the national championships, how? They changed the game. Instead of conventional basketball, they ran a full court press every game all the time. Now, why did that work? It worked because when you're the underdog, letting your opponent play the game that they trained for is a sure path to losing. Vavex opponents had very little practice against a full court press. And when they did get the ball, close enough to the goal to make a play, they were too exhausted to run to their place. And that's exactly what the second tier brand, in the cough cold category did that year. They took place right out of Vavex playbook. Instead of only running ads during cough, cold and allergy season, they started advertising 12 months a year. The ground they picked up in off-peak, gave them a head start the next peak season. They also stopped marketing their brands as only good for colds and allergies. For example, you can use facial tissues to remove makeup or wipe away tears, not just blow your nose. And while most brands market their products exclusively to women, they started advertising to men also. All those new users and new buyers grew their market share even more. Well, the final line in the article, said that after five years of executing these strategies, this distant little second place brand, had just overtaken the dominant brand in market share, for the first time in its 50 year history. David 37%, Goliath 36%. And then at the bottom of the article, was a handwritten note that said, "Thanks for everything you did to achieve these amazing results," signed the boss. Now, yes, because it was dated in the future, you could consider this a vision story but make no mistake, this was a strategy story. It explained each piece of the brand strategy and why each one would work. Using layman's terms and a brilliant's analogy and an inspiring story. Well, by the afternoon, people all over the office, had pinned that article to their cubicle walls, because for the first time, they finally understood the strategy in a way that they could understand, appreciate, and most importantly, execute. A well crafted strategy story can do the same for you. So, to try this particular execution, pick a date in the future, by which your strategy should have worked. And then write what amounts to a newspaper or a magazine article, looking back at your success. And include all the metrics of success, like revenues, and profits and market share whatever, and describe each component of your strategy, in terms of how it played out and how it impacted your business results versus your competitors. Now, you certainly don't need to use a sports analogy, and it doesn't have to be a story looking back from the future. It can just be a hypothetical story delivered in present tense, starting with, "Imagine this," and then follow that with the journey to take you where you want to go. And that becomes your strategy story. </li>
</ul>
<p>What we believe (a corporate values story)</p>
<ul>
<li>Every company has them, corporate value statements. Now, sometimes they're called company values and principles, or simply, what we believe. But values are only words on a piece of paper until they're tested, until someone is put in a difficult position of choosing between doing the hard right or the easy wrong. Now, that's why stories are uniquely called for when trying to establish values in an organization. Only a story can convey the uncomfortable or awkward predicament required to truly define a value. So, here's an example. It's likely that you've heard of Sam Walton who founded Walmart in 1962 in Arkansas, but you may not be familiar with Florence Butt, the woman who founded H.E. Butt, or H-E-B, grocery stores in San Antonio, Texas in 1905. Now, for much of the 20th century, H-E-B was the largest grocery store chain in Texas. That is, until Walmart came along. And then within a couple of decades, Walmart had overtaken H-E-B as the leading grocer in Texas. Well, by that time, Charles Butt, the grandson of the founder, was the CEO of the company, and in an effort to learn from his now larger competitor, Charles Butt once asked Sam Walton if he could bring his leadership team to Walmart's headquarters on a learning mission. Now, that probably seems kind of weird since they're obviously competitors, but Sam Walton agreed to do it anyway. So, on a scheduled day, Charles Butt and his whole executive team arrived in Arkansas and met Sam at one of his local stores. Well, when Charles walked in, he could see Sam at the end of a long aisle talking to a customer, so Charles walked up the aisle with his team. Well, when Sam saw him, he stopped them and said, Charles, I'll be with you in a minute. I'm talking to this young woman. He was trying to sell her an ironing board cover. And after a few more minutes of conversation, the woman put one of the ironing board covers in her cart and pushed off to the register. Sam then turned to Charles and asked him, in all seriousness, Charles, do you know how many worn out ironing board covers there are in this country? We're going to sell one million of them this month. Now, imagine you're an employee at Walmart today and your boss told you that story. What lessons about company values could you learn? Here's my list. First, other retailers are our competitors, not our enemies. We work in the same industry serving the same customers. You know, if we can help each other serve those customers without giving away our competitive secrets, we should. Second, the customer is number one. You know, even though he'd invited H-E-B's CEO to fly hundreds of miles just to meet with him, Sam Walton chose to make the CEO wait while he helped a customer. Third, understanding the customer's wants and needs is important. How do you think Sam knew there were so many worn out ironing board covers in the country? He asked. Okay, fourth, persistence pays off. Valuing persistence means you don't give up until you've helped the customer find what he or she is looking for. Sam didn't quit until the woman was satisfied with her choice and put the ironing board cover in her cart. And last, passion wins. Out of the billions of dollars in merchandise Walmart sells every year, Sam had set a goal specifically for how many ironing board covers he wanted to sell, a million this month, and he was clearly excited by the challenge. Passion is contagious. Spread it, and you'll be amazed what you can accomplish. So, notice that a story like this can communicate not just one, but a number of different values at the same time, and it does so far better than a corporate value statement ever could. So, to come up with your own value stories, start by finding your company value statement. It's probably hidden in a dusty drawer somewhere. Go through each item on the list and ask these questions. When have I seen someone's behavior exemplify this value? What happened, and how did it reflect on that person and the company? Or, when have I seen someone's behavior show the opposite character? What happened, and what were the negative consequences for that person and the company? And then, pick the situation that best illustrates the value or values most important to you personally. Build a story around that moment, share it, and ask people what values they learn from it but before telling them what you learned from it. Chances are, they'll learn the same thing you did. </li>
</ul>
<p>Who we serve (a customer story)</p>
<ul>
<li>A desk is a dangerous place from which to view the world. That's the observation of a spy novelist named John le Carre. But it's just as fitting in the business world. You know if the only customer information used in your organization comes from dry Powerpoint presentations and impersonal statistical data, you probably don't understand your customer any more than you understand your own medical charts. No, there's just no substitute for getting out of the office and meeting your customer face-to-face. But since not everyone in the company can do that as often as they should, you, as the leader should be telling the stories of the people who did. Especially the truly enlightened ones. So, here's an example. In 1993, Rohini was a new marketing manager for a brand of disposable feminine hygiene pads in India. And she was on a three-day trip in Chennai doing in-home research. And her goal was to find out what was causing low-income women to buy her expensive brand of disposable pads when they had been using cheap, reusable cloth pads. And, one of those in-home visits was in a two-room apartment with a small kitchen alcove, no TV, no refrigerator, and no air conditioning. You know a man's shirt was hanging from two nails on the other side of the door along with his trousers and a towel. And on the table, under the window, was a pile of schoolbooks covered in brown paper. Now, she described their conversation this way. Early on in the discussion it became clear that she wasn't using our product for herself, she was buying it for her eighth grade daughter who'd been using cloth. So, I asked her why she'd started spending money on it if her daughter had already become used to cloth. And the woman replied, well, it's because she has to go to school. Well, what did your daughter do about school when she was using cloth? Oh, she would go, all right, but she just felt uncomfortable, you know couldn't concentrate. But with these pads, she doesn't feel the wetness so she feels more comfortable and she doesn't have to worry about staining. But don't you think that's a bit expensive for you just to give your daughter a comfortable feeling every once in awhile? Oh yes, it's expensive, she said, but she needs to be able to concentrate in school to get good marks. So Rohini asked, well, why is that important? After all, you'll presumably just want to get her married after school, so why are good marks important? And the woman said, well, I want her to study further after school. I don't want her to get married too early. Well, but you, yourself got married at the age of 16. What's wrong with that? And then the woman leaned forward in her chair and she looked Rohini right in the eyes and said, I don't want my daughter to be like me. I want my daughter to be financially independent, to be able to be comfortable in the outside world. You know whether she marries or not will be up to her. She has to study, get good marks, and go to college and then get a job. I don't want her to have two kids by the age of 20. You know, I live my life through my children. I don't have many aspirations for my own life now, but my daughter must be different from me. And that's why these pads make sense. Now, no doubt Rohini's team wrote a proper, clinical summary of their conclusions and observations on that research trip. But the most effective vehicle she left for helping others understand the customer was the intimate portrait contained in the story about meeting that one woman in Chennai. So, to come up with your own customer stories, do this. First, get out of the office and meet your customer face-to-face. Go on a sales call with the sales team, tag along with the research department on a customer visit, stop a shopper in the aisle at a grocery store when you see them buying your product. Whatever you have to do, make it happen. Then, when you get back, write a story about your experience and what you learned. In fact, ask other leaders about their personal experiences with consumers and cuatomers. Somebody has a great customer story like Rohini's. Find it and tell that story. </li>
</ul>
<p>What we do for our customers (a sales story)</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever listened to someone explain what they do for a living, after which you didn't have the slightest clue what they actually did? Of course you have. It might sound something like this: I run a company that integrates siloed marketing platforms into a single digital information exchange. You know, what does that even mean? Now, perhaps some of you are even thinking that sometimes the person spewing out those meaningless buzzwords is you. And that's one reason you need at least one good story to help explain in concrete terms what it is you or your company does for your customers. All right, here's an example. Ben Koberna is the founder and CEO of a reverse auction company. That means it finds and condenses several suppliers to participate in a competitive bidding process to supply whatever it is the client needs at the cheapest cost. And while that short description does accurately describe what his company does, it leaves all kinds of questions unanswered. So, when he's talkin' to a new prospect, he almost always tells the story about one of his very first clients. Now, it was a mid-size city government in Central Florida. And they'd been paying $250,000 a year for a contractor to haul away the sludge from their wastewater treatment plant. So, they hired his company to do a reverse auction to see if they could save some money. He explained what they did this way. He said, we looked around and found several sludge-removal companies that were interested. Then we invited them to a pre-bid meeting, so we could explain the process. Well, the guy who had the contract at the time showed up with his layer, yelling and screaming, and he even kicked over a chair. I mean, he told us the whole process was illegal and said we were all going to be arrested. Well, we eventually got him settled down and started the bidding process. So, his first bid was for $250,000, of course. But then, when more aggressive bids started coming in, he lowered his bid to 240,000, and then 200,000, and then 150,000. The next bid he put in, though, was for zero dollars. Now, obviously, that was a mistake, so we paused the auction and called him on the phone. We explained his mistake and told him we could strike that bid and reset the auction. But he told us that wouldn't be necessary. He said, "I didn't make a mistake. "I've been sellin' that sludge to local farmers "for the last 20 years to use as fertilizer. "I'll just come pick it up for free." And my client has been saving $250,000 a year ever since. Now, notice how Ben's story answers a lot of questions his customers ask, and even some they don't even know to ask or are afraid to ask. For example, the story answers questions like, do I have to find all the vendors to bid? Nope, that's our job. And how do we explain to them how the process will work? You don't, we do that for you in a pre-bid meeting. But it also answers this more uncomfortable question: Will my current supplier get mad at me for doing this? Because the truth is, in Ben's experience, they will get mad. And most clients will worry about that because they've been doing business with these people for years. They know them personally. And nobody wants to upset someone you've known and worked with for a long time. But as the story illustrates, it doesn't matter if they get upset because they won't get mad at the client, they're going to get mad at Ben. That's part of what the client is paying for, for his company to shoulder the brunt of the emotional reaction this kind of a process creates. All the client has to do is save money. Okay, if you have personal experience workin' with customers, you might be able to craft this story by yourself. If not, you'll need the help of someone in the sales department. They probably even have stories like this they can tell you off the top of their head. Share this story with them as an example of what you're looking for. And then do the following: First, choose a client from a typical industry you serve, preferably one with a great experience working with you. And you don't have to use the client's real name. Next, sketch out a brief outline of events that led up to them needing your product or service. It has to be a specific instance. Then list the main steps of what your company did for them, all right? And then last, explain the outcome in terms of how it benefited the customer. That's it, that's your sales story. </li>
</ul>
<p>How we're different from our competitors (a marketing story)</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing is about differentiation. It communicates how your product or service is different from your competitors. And marketers use all kinds of methods to communicate that differentiation, like television commercials and product demos and samples sent to your home. But as a leader, whether you're talking to a perspective customer, the investment community, or just helping the people in your department appreciate why your company's product is better than your competition, your best tool is a story. Okay, here's an example. Sharad Madison is the CEO of the commercial cleaning company United Building Maintenance. They're the ones that come in and clean your offices at night. Now when Sharad is trying to explain how his company is different from his competitors he often tells the following story about what he does when he acquires a new client. He says, when we take over a new contract we typically have a 30 day transition period. We take that time to go into the building in the middle of the night to see how they're cleaning it now, to find out if they're properly trained and have the right tools. For example, we recently took over the contract for the Verizon building in New Jersey. Now that's a 1.7 million square foot property across multiple buildings. So we went in and found a guy vacuuming the carpet. Now it turns out he was using the same kind of residential quality vacuum cleaner you probably use at home. Now those hallways are 12 feet wide and over 1/2 a mile long. Can you imagine trying to clean the whole thing with the same machine you use at home? It could take a week and it probably still wouldn't be very clean. Plus, that vacuum will have to be replaced every few months. Well, we ordered him a triple wide industrial strength vacuum cleaner that'll do the job in less than half the time and last forever. Well, then we went to another floor and we found someone shampooing those same carpets with a regular walk behind squeeze bottle shampooer. Again, that could take all night just to shampoo that one floor. So we put him into a high speed riding shampooer that could do the job in a fraction of the time with much better results. Plus, it gets the guy off his feet, so I have fewer workman's comp issues and so does my client. Well, then we got to the offices and started looking at the top of the file cabinets. And you could see half moons swiped out on top of them and he said, I know exactly what that meant. Those cabinets were 5 1/2 feet tall and several of the people cleaning them were shorter than that. So it's not that they're lazy, they just literally couldn't reach high enough to clean all the way to the back. So when we took over we gave them all these little plastic extension wands that they could reach all the way to the back with. Problem solved. Now compare that story to how Sharad might explain his points of differentiation if he was using one of the more typical features and benefits type of marketing language. It'd sound something like this, you know what makes us different is that we equip our cleaners with triple wide industrial strength vacuum cleaners, high speed riding shampooers, and extension wands for dusting, and that's how we're different. Now that, of course, all is true, those are the facts, but the story is far more compelling, because with the story the listener can see all those pieces of equipment in use. They can see the guy going from the cheap vacuum cleaner to the triple wide one. They can picture the guy riding around on a shampooer like the Zamboni driver on an ice skating rink. They can see very clearly someone easily cleaning all the way to the back of a tall, dusty cabinet with a plastic extension wand. Okay, here's some tips to help you craft your own marketing story. Ask the following questions, and you might need to get some input from the sales or marketing or research departments to find good answers. All right, first, think of a time that you or someone else used one of your competitor's products or services and had a bad experience. What was that experience like? And how does it differ from an experience with your product? Okay, second, think of some of the most positive customer success stories at your company. What was so fabulous about them that isn't likely to happen with your competitor's products? And last, and this is my favorite, talk to some of your customers who used to use your competitor's products, but have switched to you. What about their experience made them switch? And what's it like now with your product? Okay, choose one of those experiences and craft a story around it that illustrates the difference between your product or service and your competitors. It could simply be two stories told back to back. A bad customer experience with your competitor's product and a good customer experience with your product. That's your marketing story. </li>

<p>Why I lead the way I do (a leadership philosophy story)</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever met with someone at work and they handed you a sheet of paper that lays out the leadership principles they operate by? Yeah, I've always been impressed with people forward thinking enough to have their own personal leadership philosophy, but I'm rarely impressed with what that philosophy actually is. You know, it's usually just a bunch of trite platitudes and meaningless buzzwords that sounds something like this: my leadership philosophy is to synergistically leverage my organizations unique capabilities and value added activities to drive employee engagement, outside the box thinking, and ultimately maximize value creation. No, ah! I mean, that is so vague and impersonal, I could've taken any of the dozens I've been handed in the past and switched the names at the top and it would not have made a difference. All right, a bunch of buzzwords on a piece of paper, could never adequately articulate the subtle, complex, and human nature of leadership. You know, the only thing capable of that kind of finesse, is a story, or more likely, several stories, but let's start with one. So, in 1995, Mike Figliuolo was a tank platoon leader in the US Army, in charge of 15 soldiers and four tanks. Well in April of that year, his platoon was getting ready for a field training exercise, so essentially it was a war game with real tanks and a real field, but with simulated weapons. So it was basically a game of laser tag with tanks and as fate would have it, Mike's tank would literally be the first tank among 400 vehicles going into battle in wedge formation on his side of the field. Now, before the exercise, Mike and his commanding officer had looked at a, at the map of the field. And there were several hills and they decided on one particular pass between them that would be the safest and the fastest route. So, when the game started, Mike's tank, of course, sped toward the enemy as planned, but a battlefield rarely looks like it does on a map, especially when you're looking at it through the tiny opening in a hatch while moving 40 miles per hour and being shot at. So, when they got to the hills, Mike wasn't sure which way to go so he had a decision to make. Now option one, he could stop the tank, pull out the map, and figure out the right way to go. But, the tanks were all in a very tight formation and all of them would have to stop with him and that would leave them all sitting in the open, subject to enemy fire, all right. Option two, he could make an educated guess, keep moving forward, and take his chances. Mike chose option two. He yelled out, "Driver go left, take the left pass." Less than a minute late, Mike's tank got taken out by a laser. And a few seconds later, his wingman got taken out as well as the third tank, but the fourth tank, and all the other 396 tanks in the battalion saw what happened and realized it was the wrong decision. All of them headed right, flooded through the correct pass and won the battle. Now, it was an important lesson for Mike. It taught him the value of decisiveness. You know, in war, and in business, it's often better to make the wrong decision quickly, then to make the right decision slowly. You know, bad decisions usually become evident before too long and can be corrected. But indecision can cost you the battle because while you're studying the problem, your opponents are still moving forward. So, now as a business leader, he rarely falls victim to the analysis paralysis that troubles so many leaders today. You know, by comparison, his decisions can seem quick, but he also has a higher tolerance for mistakes, as long as people learn from those mistakes and sharing his story of that field training exercise is one way he helps his partners and clients expect that kind of decisive leadership behavior from him and plan accordingly. And a story like that, of your own, can do the same for you. So, to look for personally defining moments, like this, in your life as a leader, ask yourself these questions: what was your biggest leadership mistake and what did you learn from it? What leadership decision are you most proud of and why? What leader do you most admire and what was the moment your realized you did? And what one or two principles are you least willing to sacrifice to achieve your goals and why? So, pick one of the moments you thought of from that list of questions and build a story around it. That will be your personal leadership philosophy story. </li>

<p>Why you should want to work here (a recruiting story)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you've ever been to a job fair, you've seen this yourself. Go up to any of the booths and ask the recruiter why you should want to work at their company. I can tell you the answers you'll get. Competitive pay and benefits, challenging jobs, a chance to work with smart people, and great opportunities for advancement. And if the job fair's in Silicon Valley, you'll also hear about the free lunch and the foosball table in the break room. Now, then go to the next booth, and ask the same question. Right, you'll get the same answer, and that's why you need a recruiting story. After hearing about the salary and the other basics, human beings need a human reason to make a decision as important as what company to work for. That story could help them understand what it's really like to work there. It could illustrate a unique and creative way someone made the decision to take the job or it could be a surprising reason why someone chose to stay working at your company, instead of quitting like they'd planned. Now, no matter which it is, it's something that you, as the leader, can give them that's not in the brochure. Here's an example. In the spring of '93, I was just finishing my MBA. I'd already been through a dozen job interviews and was trying to decide what to do next. Now, I was fortunate that the job market was strong that year, so I ended up with several offers, and with companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Unilever, and Procter &amp; Gamble, it was going to be a tough decision. All of them had roughly the same compensation and benefits, and even the career paths and job assignments were remarkably similar. I was a bit stumped. I pulled out the phone book, and I called an executive search firm. Now, I told the first person who would talk to me that I didn't need their services yet, but that I still wanted their advice. I told the guy on the other end of the line my situation. New MBA grad, multiple job offers, etc. I gave him the names of all the companies and all the jobs and all the salaries that I'd been offered. And then I asked him this question. I said, "If I called you five years from now, "and wanted to move to a new company, "which of these companies "would you find it easiest to place me from?" And then, without hesitating, the guy said, "Oh, Procter &amp; Gamble." I said, "Well, how can you be so sure?" He said, "Two reasons. "First, I place people into and out of all those companies "all the time. "And then after a year, "I call them up and ask them how things are going. "For the people I place out of P&amp;G into other companies, "I consistently hear this complaint. "'It's good here, but the people just aren't as talented "as I was used to working with at P&amp;G.' "And I rarely heard that complaint in the other direction." "And the second reason?" I asked? He said, "Because P&amp;G is still "a promote from within company, and none of the others are. "That means they only hire people at the entry-level. "I can get you a job at any of those other companies "any time you want, but if you ever want to work at P&amp;G, "you'll have to do it now." I started my job at P&amp;G in June, and that three-minute phone call with a head hunter was the reason why. Now, for the next several years, anytime I found myself on the P&amp;G recruiting team headed back to my alma mater to woo the next round of MBA graduates, I brought that story with me. Now, it certainly didn't replace the flashy PowerPoint presentations and expensive dinner budgets, and it didn't replace the talking points and list of reasons to come work at P&amp;G, but a lot of companies give the same reasons. Having one more person on the recruiting team repeat that list doesn't help much. But the story was unique. It articulated real points of difference and it allowed the listener to consider making the same phone call I did, not just take my word for it. Okay, tips to help you craft your own recruiting story. Ask yourself, and the people you work with, these three questions. What made you want to come work here? Why do you stay? And have you ever thought about quitting, but decided not to? If so, what made you change your mind? Now, keep asking until you come across a great story. Not everyone will have one, but somebody will. </li>

<ul>
<li>So there you have the 10 stories that every leader needs to be able to tell and if you haven't already, it's time to start finding and crafting your own and you can start by just searching your own past for stories similar to the ones you heard here but don't stop there. Get stories from other people. Try holding a contest and giving away a prize for the best story. Solicit customer stories on your website and offer an incentive to share. Share this list of stories with your coworkers and family and friends, really anyone who might have a great story. You'll be surprised how willing people are to share their stories when they know you're looking for one. Now, once you find a story, don't just take it and use it the way you heard it. Chances are you can do much better. These really are the most important stories that any leader will ever tell. It's worthwhile to spend a little time refining it so that it's as compelling, memorable and effective as it can be. Now, to learn how to do that, you'll want to check out one of my other courses here on LinkedIn Learning called Leading with Stories. You'll learn how to use the right story structure, create the right level of emotional engagement and keep the story interesting and memorable with the element of surprise. Also, if you'd like to go deeper into any of these stories, check out my book The 10 Stories Great Leaders Tell and if you have questions or want to connect, reach out to me on LinkedIn. Best of luck with your leadership stories. </li>

<p>Addressing leadership with story</p>
<ul>
<li>Here's one of the dirtiest little secrets in the leadership business, bossing people around has never really worked that well. You know wagging your finger at someone and telling them what to do just isn't the most effective way to get the kind of performance and teamwork you want. I mean sure it can sometimes work in the short term but long term that kind of autocratic management style just leads to resentment. You know a far better method is to inspire your organization to want to do what you want them to do and the best tool you have to do that is storytelling. Which is exactly what this course will do for you, teach you how to craft compelling leadership stories. My name is Paul Smith and I'm a leadership and storytelling trainer and author of the bestselling book Lead with a Story. Now I've interviewed hundreds of CEOs and executives at dozens of companies around the world to uncover what leadership stories you need and how to tell them. In this course we'll start by understanding what a leadership story is and why storytelling works so well as a leadership tool. Then we'll explore the most important types of stories leaders should be telling. But we'll spend most of our time in this course exploring how to craft these stories. Including a simple story structure and techniques to create the right level of emotion and even a surprise ending. This course will help you tell better leadership stories. Let's get started. </li>
</ul>
<p>What a leadership story is and is not</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because you can give a good speech or make a good presentation, doesn't mean you can tell a good story. You know, not every compelling set of words that comes out of your mouth is a story. A story is something special. Now, stated simply, a story is a narrative about something interesting that happened to someone. Now, what that means is a real story will have these six attributes. A time, a place, a main character, that main character will have a goal, there'll be an obstacle getting in the way of that goal, and there should be events that transpire along the way and resolve themselves nicely in the end. Now, to help you tell the difference between an actual leadership story and other kinds of communication, I put a short quiz in the exercise files for this course. Now, it has three short narratives, and your job is to identify which ones are actual stories and which ones are not. And it's not as easy as you might think. Until you can tell the difference between a real leadership story and something posing as one, you'll never be able to craft one yourself. So, try the quizzes out, and see how you do. But before then, let me give you an example of one of my favorite leadership stories so you can see what I'm talking about. In 1971, Bob McDonald was a first year cadet at the US Military Academy in West Point. And he learned pretty quickly that there were only four acceptable answers to any question asked by a superior officer. Yes sir, no sir, I don't understand sir, and no excuse sir. Now, the example he gives is, imagine I've shined my shoes, and my trousers are pressed, and I go out to formation. Now, while I'm standing there in line, one of my classmates runs past and steps in a puddle and splashes mud all over my shoes and trousers. And then an upperclassman walks by and notices, and says, McDonald, why are you in formation with mud all over your shoes and trousers? Now, I've got to go through all four possible answers in my head. Now, I could say yes sir, but that would just restate the obvious. I could say no sir, but that's not even true, and I'd get thrown out of the academy for lying. Now, I could say I don't understand sir, but that would just make me look stupid, and I was doing a good enough job of that already. So, the only answer I had left was the fourth one. And it's the most powerful one of all. No excuse sir. Now, even when something happened to me that was outside of my control, I wasn't supposed to make any excuses. I was supposed to say, no excuse sir. It won't happen again. That's how a West Point cadet takes responsibility, which is an important part of character. Well, Bob was reminded that lesson 13 years later when he and his wife were discussing what to do about their six-year-old daughter, Jenny. Now, they just couldn't see to get her to clean her room. And so at one point, they marched into Jenny's room to give her a good reprimand. And now, Bob said, Jenny, we'd like to talk to you about the condition of your room. But before he could even get to his second sentence, Jenny looked up at him, and with all the seriousness of a West Point cadet said, "No excuse, Dad. "It won't happen again." She'd obviously been listening to him tell his West Point stories. Now, Bob and his wife just stood there in awkward silence. Dumbfounded, really. Trying to figure out what to say next. With those seven simple words, Jenny had acknowledged the state of her room, taken responsibility for it, and promised not to let it happen again. There was really nothing left to say, so they kissed their little girl on the cheek, and left her to clean her room. Now, for decades after that, Bob shared that story with his leaders to teach them the same lesson, including in his tenure as the CEO and chairman of the largest consumer products company in the world, Procter and Gamble. Now, in that role, one of his primary responsibilities was to set stretching goals and objectives for the company, and to get all 127,000 employees committed to delivering them You know, truly committing to a goal means that if it isn't met, you take responsibility for it, and promise to get it done. The no excuse sir response is a clear indication of commitment and responsibility. And it works just as well in the business world as it does in the military academy, or in parenting a six-year-old. And it works for the boss just as much as it does for the subordinate. When the boss hears, no excuse, however it's articulated, she can be certain that her subordinate is taking responsibility, and is still committed to the goal. For the direct report, the disarming no excuse response spares him a lengthy reprimand from the boss. Just like it spared Jenny. So, when I say a leadership story, I really do mean a story about something that happened to someone that other people can learn from. It's not just a clever speech or a great presentation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Why storytelling works</p>
<ul>
<li>There's nothing wrong with the way most leaders talk to their employees, or write their memos, or give their speeches, or even make their presentations. But all those things could be much more effective if they included a few good stories. Here are five of the most compelling reasons why. Number one, storytelling speaks to the part of the brain where decisions are actually made. You know, apparently, human beings don't always make the logical, rational decisions that we like to think we do. More often than not, we make subconscious, emotional, and sometimes even irrational decisions in one place in our brain, and then we justify those decisions logically and rationally a few nanoseconds later in a conscious thinking part of the brain. So, if you're trying to influence what people think and feel and do, in other words, leadership, using facts and rational arguments alone aren't enough. You need to influence the subconscious, emotional processing part of the brain as well. Stories are your best vehicle to do that. Okay, number two. Stories are viral by nature. You tell a good story, and it will spread all over your world, however big your world is. People love to share good stories, so they do, just by word-of-mouth. But I'll bet that doesn't happen to your policy memos and corporate emails. Number three, stories make things easier to remember. A number of studies have shown that facts are between six and 22 times more likely to be remembered if they're embedded in a story than if they're just given to people in a list. But you don't have to believe any of the studies, because I'm going to prove it to you right now. That is that all of you watching this right now know that by this time tomorrow, none of you are going to remember this list of five things. That's okay, I'm not going to be offended. But all of you watching this right now also know that by this time tomorrow, you will remember the details of the last interesting story that you heard. Next week, next month, and next year, most of you will be able to tell that story and get most of the facts right, but none of you will remember this list of five things. That's the power of a good story. All right, number four. Stories appeal to all types of learners. You probably learned in high school that there are three basic types of learners. Auditory, people who learn best from what they hear, visual, people who learn best from what they see, and kinesthetic. That's people who learn best from what they do or feel. Well, it turns out storytelling works with all three. You know, auditory learners obviously benefit from hearing a good story, but what about visual learners? Well, what do you think they're doing while you're telling your story? They're watching it play out in their mind's eye like a movie, right? But if you tell them something that's not in the form of a story, there's no movie to watch in their head, so they won't learn it as well. And the kinesthetic learners, those people remember and connect with the emotions and the feelings in the story. So, unlike just about every other form of communication, storytelling works for all three types of learners. Lastly, number five. Stories inspire. Slides don't. I mean, when's the last time you heard someone say, "Wow, you'll never believe "the PowerPoint presentation I just saw!" Never, right? But you do hear people say that about great stories. </li>
</ul>
<p>When to tell leadership stories</p>
<ul>
<li>Storytelling is a leadership tool, not a management tool. So when you're trying to make a decision or run more efficient process, storytelling isn't necessarily the best tool to turn to. But if what you're trying to do is lead people, storytelling is an absolutely indispensable skill to have. Now that's the conclusion I came to after interviewing hundreds of CEOs and leaders about their use of storytelling. You know, I asked them what situations they found themselves in when they decided to tell a story, what story they told and if it worked. And now, each leader probably told me somewhere between eight and 12 different stories, so do the math and I've literally documented around 3,000 individual leadership stories. Now that's allowed me to reverse engineer my way into what works and what doesn't, but what it also did was give me some insight into the diversity of leadership challenges where storytelling can help and all the stories seem to fit nicely into 21 different categories and I've organized them into five different groups based on the overall goal. Now the first group I called envision. You know, those are stories to help you set a vision for the future, to build accountability and commitment to goals, to lead change, to make your recommendations stick or to define customer service excellence. Now the next group is about the environment that a leader creates. Now those are stories to help define the culture and the values of an organization to encourage collaboration, to value diversity and inclusion or even to set policy without creating a bunch of new rules. Now the third group I called energize. So those are stories to help inspire and motivate the team, to build courage for a tough task or even to help people just find the passion for their work again. Now the next one is educate. Those are stories that you tell to teach an important lesson or provide coaching and feedback, to demonstrate how to solve tough problems and how to get people to understand the customer. Now the last group is empower. Now those are stories that you tell to delegate authority and give permission or to encourage creativity and innovation or to create master salespeople and even to earn respect in the organization. Now I'll admit it might be hard to see exactly how you could create a story for all 21 of those situations without hearing a few examples. So fortunately, we've got several other LinkedIn courses that can help you with that. The first is called Leadership Stories Weekly and it's a collection of 52 leadership stories where I'll give you concrete examples of how stories can be used for all kinds of leadership purposes. Alright, next. If you work in sales and marketing, I've got another LinkedIn course that illustrates 25 different types of stories that are helpful across the entire sales process from meeting a prospect to closing a sale. Now it's called Selling with Stories, Part Two Stories Great Sales People Tell. Now that's an awful lot of stories because there probably is an infinite number of uses for storytelling in the workplace, but in my course called Stories Great Leaders Tell, I give you specific examples of what I think are the 10 most important stories that every leader should be able to tell at any time and here's the list. The first four go together and they're about setting direction for the organization. Where we came from, our founding story. Why we can't stay here, the case for change story. Where we're going, a vision story and how we're going to get there, a strategy story. Now the next four are about who we are as an organization. What we believe, a corporate value story. Who we serve, a customer story. What we do for our customers, a sales story and how we're different from our competitors, a marketing story and the last two are a little more personal. Why I lead the way I do, a leadership philosophy story and why you should want to work here, a recruiting story. So if you want to listen to concrete examples of any of those types of leadership stories, check out the courses I mentioned. </li>
</ul>
<p>What makes a great story a great story</p>
<ul>
<li>What is it that makes a great story a great story? Now I'd argue that for any kind of story, whether that's a business story or the kind of story you'd read in a book or see in a movie, there are three things that make it great. A hero we care about. A villain we're afraid of. And an epic battle between them. Now I'll admit that sounds a bit Hollywood so let's translate that into something more realistic. That hero we care about just becomes a relatable main character, someone your audience can relate to. The villain we're afraid of just becomes a relevant challenge, the kind of problem your audience might find themselves facing. And the epic battle between them just becomes an honest struggle. The audience needs to see the main character struggle a bit to solve the problem. And since this is a leadership story and not just a story to entertain people, we have to add a fourth element to the list and that's this, that the audience learns a worthy lesson. In fact, that's the first element you should consider in choosing a story, the lesson it teaches. Now that may sound obvious and it should be but I can't tell you how many emails I get from people who ask, "Hey, I've got a big presentation next week. "You got any good stories I could use?" As if I could possibly recommend a good story without having the slightest clue what their presentation is about or what their objectives are. It just doesn't work that way. So choose a story based on the message you're trying to convey. Okay, next let's talk about the relatable main character. The most compelling character for one of your stories is someone your audience can identify with. That means they can either imagine themselves in the same position or working with that person. Now I know a lot of leaders who like to tell stories about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Jack Welch and those are fine, but most people can't see themselves as a high-tech visionary or a titan of industry. Plus, the fact that Bill Gates did something amazing might be entertaining, but it won't help most people do their jobs better because they're not Bill Gates. But you tell them a story about someone who had their job five years ago and was facing the same challenge that they're facing now, they'll be all ears. Okay, next the relevant challenge. The challenge is a problem or an opportunity the main character runs into. Now when it's a problem, the challenge plays the role of the villain in the story but that doesn't mean the villain has to be a person. The obstacle could be one of your competitors or the mountain you're trying to climb or even the photocopy machine you finally get your revenge on. And when it's an opportunity, it becomes the motivating force driving the main character like a challenging goal say to grow sales by 50% or an opportunity like getting a new job or a promotion. Regardless of what the challenge is though, it should be relevant to the audience. All right, last, let's talk about the honest struggle. The struggle between the hero and the villain is the heart and the soul of storytelling. If there's no struggle, there's no story. That means it can't be too easy for the hero to get what they're after. Here's an example. Bob desperately needed a 3/4 inch socket wrench to finish his project. There was simply no way to complete the job on time without one. So he reached in his toolbox and he grabbed one. The end. Do you see how wrong that is? I mean it's so wrong it's actually shocking probably because it violates our core understanding of what a story should sound like. The story has a main character, Bob, and an obstacle, the lack of a socket wrench, but there's just no struggle. It's too easy. We can't care about Bob or his project until we see him struggle. Your audience has to see your main character struggle. So if your stories have these four elements, you almost certainly have a decent story. </li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the right story to tell</p>
<ul>
<li>The most important part of storytelling is choosing the right story to tell. If you tell the wrong story it doesn't matter how well you tell it you won't accomplish your objective. So how do you come up with the right story to tell? Three simple steps. Step one, define your objective. Always start with the end in mind and since the most important element of a great story is that the story has a worthy lesson you have to start by determining what lesson you want your audience to learn. Now specifically what do you want your audience to think, feel, or do as a result of hearing your story. Now once you can articulate that clearly in your mind you're ready to move on to step two. Think of a relevant success, failure, or moment of clarity around your objective. That thing that you want your audience to think, feel, or do. In other words, think of times in the past when you or someone else has done that thing really, really well a success or really, really badly a failure because we learn as much from our failures as we do our successes. Or when you learned that lesson the first time yourself, a moment of clarity. Now if that situation taught you the lesson so well it'll teach others when they hear about it through a story. Okay, if nothing comes to mind from your past then move on to step three, go on a story hunt. Every story you tell shouldn't be about you anyway. If they were you'd come across as a bit of a self absorbed leader. Now you should have stories about other people in your repertoire so find them, ask your boss, your subordinates, your peers, anyone really for help finding the stories that you're looking for. Create a wish list of stories that you need and share the list. You'd be surprised how willing people are to tell you their stories when they know what you're looking for. </li>
</ul>
<p>Story structures</p>
<ul>
<li>All good stories have a structure. Without it, you might skip an important part of the story or just as bad, put a bunch of stuff in that you don't need. I've seen too many fabulous four-minute leadership stories wind up as boring, ineffective, 10-minute nightmares because they didn't follow a good structure. I'm going to lay out the structure I recommend, and if you follow that structure, it'll make sure you answer the eight questions every story should answer. Let's walk through those sections first, and then the eight questions, okay? All right, first, the hook is what gets your audience to pay attention. The context is the setting of the story, where and when it took place. The challenge is the problem or opportunity the main character ran into. Now, that's where the hero meets the villain the first time. The conflict is the action of the story. That's where the hero actually does battle with the villain. The resolution is how everything turned out in the end. And the lesson and recommended action are where you draw conclusions and move your listener to some kind of an action. Those are the main parts. Structuring your story that way allows you to answer the eight questions your story needs to answer, and in the order you need to answer them. Here are those eight questions. The first question you have to answer is why should I listen to the story? Because if you don't answer that question in the first 10 to 15 seconds, your audience might not listen to your story. They might mentally, physically, or emotionally walk away from your story. Once you've given your listener a good reason to listen, then you've earned the right to answer the next five questions. Where and when did it take place? Who's the main character and what do they want? What was the problem or opportunity they ran into? What did they do about it? And how did it turn out in the end? And that should sound like the flow of a typical story, but you're not done yet. After you tell the story, you'll want to make sure your audience understands what they were supposed to learn and what action they should take. That's why the last two questions are what did you learn form it? And what do you think I should do now? And the order you answer those questions matters, because unlike in a business memo, the resolution and recommendation, they go at the end, not at the beginning. Just imagine if you found out at the beginning of a murder mystery who the murderer was. It'd ruin the entire story. Or imagine you're telling someone a fantastic story but you didn't answer the question about where and when it happened. Now, depending on how fantastic the story is, they might actually start wondering if it was true. In fact, sometimes it bothers them so much, they stop you and ask. They say, "C'mon Paul, is this true? "Did this really happen? "When was this? "Where was this?" They'll actually ask you question number two because until they get those questions answered, it's just too hard for them to move on to the rest of the story. That's how stories should flow. They should answer the eight questions in the proper order. And doing that helps make sure that you don't leave out anything important and that the story makes sense, while also making sure you're not including too much information that can make your stories too long and too boring. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not ask permission,
Do not tell them a story is coming
Do not give away the ending</p>
<p>The hook</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the most common mistakes I see in storytelling happen right at the beginning, because people just have no idea how to get started telling their story. So before I tell you how to do it, I want to tell you how not to do it. So first, never apologize or ask permission for telling a leadership story. And you've seen this happen before. You'll be in the middle of a meeting and someone says oh I'm sorry to interrupt, but can I just tell a quick story? I promise, it'll just take a minute. Now what do you think that communicates about how important the story is? Well not very important, right? And if it's not that important, then please, don't tell it. Just get back to the bullet points on slide number 72. But if you do think your story's important, then just tell it. Leaders don't ask permission to lead, they just lead. Never apologize or ask permission to tell a leadership story. Okay second. Don't even tell your audience you're going to tell them a story. You know, imagine I'm your boss and I'm standing here in front of you to kick of a meeting and I say well okay everyone, I just wanted to get things going around here, so I thought I'd start by telling you a story. Now, what's your reaction to that so far? Well, if you're honest, most of you are rolling your eyes right now thinking ugh, do we really have time for this? Can't you just give us the facts? Now imagine instead, if I kicked off the meeting by saying something like this: well okay everyone, let's go ahead and get started. And as you may have heard, something really important happened last week, and it's completely changed how I think about running this department. I thought I'd tell you about that. Well now what's your reaction? And it's probably the polar opposite. Well, let's hear it! Now, in both cases, the boss is going to tell you exactly the same story, but announcing you're going to tell a story just makes some people feel like they're in kindergarten again, or that you're going to waste their time. Grown ups don't need to be told you're going to tell them a story, just tell it. Alright, lastly, don't kick off the story by giving away the ending or even the specific lesson. If you do, they won't have any reason to listen to your story. Now, you can tell them you're going to share the best lesson you've ever learned about running a small business, but if you tell them upfront that that lesson is to not hire family because then it's too hard to fire them when they don't work hard, they're not going to be as interested in listening to your story, because they already know how it ends, and you've already told them the lesson. Okay, so if we're not going to kick it off with an apology, asking permission, the lesson, or the word story, how do we kick off our stories? And the answer is with a simple phrase or a sentence that tells them why you're sharing the story. For example, if someone asks you a question and you want to answer it with a story, your hook could be, you know I think the best example of that I've ever seen was when, and now you're telling a story. Or if you want to give someone advice about a problem you might say gosh, that's a tough problem. Let me tell you what I did last year when I ran into that same problem, and then you're telling your story. Or if you want to share a story as an example of something you might say, so for instance, there was this one time when, and then tell your story. That's it, it's that simple. </li>
</ul>
<p>The context</p>
<ul>
<li>The context is the setting of your story. It answers the questions where and when does the story take place, who's the main character, and what do they want? Now, explaining where and when a story takes place provides instant credibility. It lets the audience know that it's a true story and not just something you made up. The second question is about the main character. Your story will be more effective the more relatable your main character is to your audience. They should be able to see themselves in that person. Stories about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs are nice every once in a while, but most of your stories should be about regular people, just like your audience. And while we're on the subject of your main character, for a lot of people, the closest they've ever come to crafting a real story at work is writing a case study. In case studies, the main character is usually a company. Now, the company did this, and the company did that. But an impersonal corporate entity isn't nearly as relatable to a human being as another human being. So, whenever possible, your main characters should be people, not companies. Don't say, "The company decided to cut its marketing budget." Say, "Sarah, the chief financial officer, "decided to cut the marketing budget." All right, the last question that context answers is, what does the main character want? In other words, what is your main character trying to achieve in the story? Are they trying to save the world or just beat their competition? Are they trying to make their profit objective or just not get fired? Whatever it is, your main character's objective should be one your audience would deem worthy. Otherwise, they lose interest in your story. Once you've shared where and when the story takes place, who the main character is, and what they wanted, then you're ready to move on to the challenge they faced. </li>
</ul>
<p>Main character should be people, not company</p>
<p>Objective - </p>
<p>Challenge, conflict, and resolution</p>
<ul>
<li>Once your audience knows the setting of the story and who your main character is, it's time to get that character into an interesting situation and see what happens to them. Let's talk about the next three parts of a story: the challenge, the conflict, and the resolution. First, let's look at the challenge, which answers the question, what was the problem or opportunity the main character ran into? Now, this is sometimes called the complication or the catalyst because it's the moment that a monkey wrench gets thrown into the hero's original plans and sets off the entire series of events in the story. It's usually pretty short, just a few sentences, but just because it's short doesn't mean it's not important. If you left out the challenge, nothing interesting could happen in the rest of the story. You need the monkey wrench or the story won't make any sense. Now, let's talk about the conflict. This is the heart and the soul of storytelling. The conflict is where you answer the question, what did the main character do about the challenge? Now, this is where the main character actually does battle with a villain, and it's important for your audience to see your main character struggle. If you find yourself introducing your hero and the challenge, and then saying something like, "And, long story short, we won the contract," you've just ruined the story because you skipped the struggle. Now there's no conflict. Don't skip the conflict. Let the audience see your main character struggle. Now, this is the single, most important part of a story, and the part where most of the plot will play out, so invest the time to get this right. In fact, it's not unusual for 50 to 60% of the words in your story to be in the conflict. Okay, last, the resolution. The resolution is where you answer the question, how did everything turn out in the end? Did the hero win or lose? Did the plan work? And this is where you wrap up any remaining loose ends. Now, a common question at this point is how do I know when I've wrapped up enough of the loose ends? And the answer is when your audience knows how to feel about what happened. Not when they know what to think about what happened. You'll cover that in the conversations about the next two questions after you're done telling the story. For now, you can stop telling the story when your audience knows how to emotionally process what happened in the story. </li>
</ul>
<p>Challenge, 
Conflict, (Important one, never skip this - most of the plot - 50 to 60 words)
Resolution, </p>
<p>Listen - </p>
<p>Lesson and action</p>
<ul>
<li>So you just told a great story. Now what? Well, the most productive thing you can do after you finish telling the story is to just listen. Remember, presumably you're having a conversation with someone. It's a requirement that you let them talk at some point. This is that point and the reason is that people are far more passionate about pursuing their ideas than they are about pursuing your ideas. Give the story a chance to work. You know, if you picked a good story to tell and did a halfway decent job of telling it, your audience will already have come to the conclusion that you wanted them to and will already be thinking about taking the action you wanted them to take. Find out and if they did, you never have to answer questions like, what should I learn from this and what do you think I should do now? Your audience will have answered them for you. Now if you find out they came to the wrong conclusion or recommended action, you can always answer the questions yourself and redirect them. Yeah, I thought about that too, but I came to a different conclusion and here's why. But if you told a great story, you won't even have to do that. </li>
</ul>
<p>Create an emotional connection</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotions play a critical role in decision-making. It turns out, human beings make subconscious emotional decisions in one place in the brain and then justify those decisions more logically and rationally a few nanoseconds later in another place in the brain. So while it may sound counterintuitive, we need emotions to make decisions, and while facts and figures and logical arguments aren't very good at reaching people emotionally, stories are great at it. In fact, one of my favorite definitions of the word story is by the novelist E. M. Forster. He said that a story was nothing more than a fact plus an emotion, and he gave a brilliantly simple example. He said, "If I were to tell you that the king died "and then the queen died, "well, that wouldn't be a story, would it? "But if I told you the king died "and then the queen died of grief, now that's a story." And why is it a story? Because with those two little words of grief, you can immediately imagine what must've happened. Oh my gosh, the queen, she must've so loved the king that when he died she stopped eating and so she withered away, or maybe she was so distraught that she took her own life, like all those stories come to mind just because of the last two words, of grief. The emotion turns the fact into a story. Now, fortunately, the folks in Hollywood figured out a long time ago how to create more of an emotional connection in stories, and you can use some of the same techniques. Here three of them. The first is just called tell me. Just name the emotion your characters are experiencing, so that your listener can be aware of it. Just saying, I was shocked or he was scared out of his wits or she was so excited is the simplest method to help your audience understand the emotion that's going on, and that's a good start, but a better technique is number two, which is called show me. Now, that doesn't mean you should start acting shocked or happy or sad, this is a leadership course, not an acting course. It means, show your audience how your characters feel by describing the physical manifestations of the emotion on the character. So instead of saying she was angry, say she started yelling or her face got beet red, or instead of saying, he was sad, say he started crying. Describe what your character did, and let the audience figure out the emotion. Now, the third technique is dialogue. People say what they think and feel, so instead of you telling the audience what the characters feel, let them hear that directly, even if it's words your characters are thinking without saying out loud. For example, instead of telling the audience that the hero was feeling anxious during her big speech, you could share her inner thoughts this way. She leaned into the microphone and said, I'm very excited to be speaking to you here today, but inside, she was thinking, oh my God, I'm so nervous, I might actually throw up. Find the moments in your story that have the highest potential for emotion and use one or more of these techniques. Your stories will be much more engaging, memorable, and effective. </li>
</ul>
<p>Emotions - Excited, Shocked</p>
<p>Tell me, </p>
<p>Show me, </p>
<p>Dialogue</p>
<p>Anxious, </p>
<p>Surprise</p>
<ul>
<li>It's no probably no surprise to you that a surprise is an important element of a great story. We all love the surprise ending in a mystery novel or the unexpected turn of events in our favorite movie. But there's actually a more important reason to include something unexpected in your leadership stories, it actually makes them more effective. A surprise at the beginning of a story gets your audience to pay attention. It shakes people out of thinking about the last email they read or the next meeting they have to go to and gets them to focus squarely on the story that you're telling them. But more than just capturing the audience's attention surprises help your audience remember the lesson at the end of the story. Now here's how that works. It turns out memories don't form instantly in a brain like pictures from a digital camera. It turns out they form over a period of time after the event happens more like pictures from an old-fashioned film camera when they're developed in a dark room. Now psychologists call that period the memory consolidation period. And it can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to a few hours. And it turns out certain chemicals like caffeine can enhance the memory consolidation process. They literally make it faster and more effective. Now another chemical that has a similar effect is adrenaline the kind of adrenaline that gets released in your system when you get frightened or surprised. So that surprise at the end of your story literally makes the ending of the story where the lesson is more memorable. So if your story doesn't have anything surprising in it, can you just skip that step and move on? Well, I suppose if you're happy with a mediocre story. But if you want a great story you should have a surprise somewhere in it. Now one technique is to create a surprise at the beginning of the story by simply starting with the most unexpected thing that happens in the story and then use the flashback technique like they do in the movies. Start with the surprise and then flashback to the beginning of the story and work your way back to the surprise. Now you can also create a surprise at the end by taking something that's important from the beginning of the story and not giving it to your audience until the end. All right here's a simple example. One day a nine-year-old boy named James was in the kitchen with his mom's sister who was having a cup of tea. Now while auntie was enjoying her tea, James was standing at the stove watching the tea kettle boil. And he was just fascinated with it. He's watching the steam come out of the top of the kettle and he had a spoon and he held it up there and watched the little drops of water that formed on the spoon and then ran down the handle and dripped into a cup and he just watched this cycle go over and over and over again just fascinated with it. Well eventually his aunt just barked at him something along the lines of, James go read a book, do your homework, go outside and ride your bike. Aren't you ashamed of yourself just wasting your time like this? Well fortunately young James was undaunted by her admonition because two decades later at the age of 29 and in the year 1765, James Watt reinvented the steam engine. Ushering in the Industrial Revolution that we of course all benefit from today and all based on a fascination with steam that he developed at the age of nine in the kitchen. Now when I first read that story it was in a book titled, James Watt, written by Andrew Carnegie in 1905. So to me it was no surprise of course that the story had in chapter one about nine-year-old James was about James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine. The entire book was a biography of James Watt but to you it was probably a surprise. And why? Because I didn't tell you his last name. I simply moved something important from the beginning of the story, his last name to the end of the story. Presto, surprise ending. It's that simple and you can do it with almost any story. </li>

<li>Congratulations, you've reach the end of this course on storytelling for leaders, but if you really want to master the craft of leadership storytelling, and turn it into a habit, you'll have to keep working at it. So, here are a few tips and tools to help get you started. First, start your own story wishlist. It'll help you figure out which stories you need the most. Okay, second, start hunting for and crafting stories on your list. You know, start with the most important, and always be on the lookout for the next story you need. Search your own past, but also ask your co workers. Show them your wishlist. You'll be surprised how many people will be willing to share their stories. Okay third. Use the Storytelling for Leaders Cheat Sheet in the exercise file, It highlights everything we covered in this course. Fourth, see examples of great leadership stories in other LinkedIn courses. Stories every leader tells, and leadership stories weekly. Fifth, create your own leadership story database to keep all your stories where you can find them. There's a blank story database you can use as a starting point in the exercise files for this course. Okay sixth, want more help crafting leadership stories? Everything we didn't have time to cover here is in my book Lead With a Story. Or, connect with me on LinkedIn, and I'll be happy to answer your questions. Finally, start telling your leadership stories. Each time you share one, take note of your audience's reaction. What worked and what didn't? What did you accidentally add or omit? Go back to the story database and make whatever changes you think necessary. Now you have everything you need to craft compelling leadership stories. </li>
