I have been with Target for the past 14 years, I love to explore new domains and quickly adapt.  So far, I got an opportunity to work in different areas like Supply chain, Point of Sale, Stores and currently with FRS. This helped me understand different parts of the Target's Business and I can connect the dots and see the bigger picture, help teams relate to Targetâ€™s purpose, vision. I led various programs, projects, engineering teams, helped perform at their best. I also helped 5 Engineers on my teams to grow into Leaders at Target. I am passionate about Technology and leadership. I have been part of the biggest transformation that happened at Target, also witnessed and contributed to the growth of Target. As a Change Agent, I helped teams to quickly adapt to the change. I created technology vision and  strategies to modernize and transitioning legacy systems and built systems to scale. I built teams from the ground up, Target shaped me as a leader through its culture, trainings, and on the job experiences. I have been aspiring to grow at Target, I am having an exciting journey.  With gamut of  experience in leading people, connections with various team across Target, different domains and technology will help me succeed as a DoT.
